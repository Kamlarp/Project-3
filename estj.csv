,ESTJ,"Please help out this overthinking, overanalyzing INFJ.

We've messaged for 2 months (due to temporary distance; sending 1-2 long messages each per week) and finally met up yesterday. We met through overlapping social circles, not a dating site or anything like that. He recommended the meetup and chose the day. He acknowledged that I'd said I was quite shy and he let me choose the location/activity from a list of options he provided (I believe for my comfort). We agreed to a walk along the river (scenic route) and I let him know he could bring his dog (which he did). There was never any indication as to whether this was just a friendly hang or a date/predate.

We walked for two hours and had some good laughs. I gained better clarity into his interests and also the many things going on in his life (definitely a busy man!). He shared with me that he has ADHD and talked about things he is working towards (buying a new house, starting a business, etc). I'm quite worried that I was way too quiet, which happens to me when I meet new people. It's as if my brain goes blank. As such, I feel like the conversations didn't go as well as they could have (entirely my fault). Hopefully he understands it is just the shyness.

At the very end, he gave me a quick hug and said that we'd have to get together again and mentioned that he'd be back in the area in 2-3 weeks for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. This was all said quite quickly and as he turned and walked to his car he called back ""talk soon.""

I wasn't able to gauge body language well as we were briskly walking for the full 2 hours and only paused briefly at our cars at the end (he had his dog to handle, who is very energetic haha).

To the ESTJs here - Is the fact that he said anything at all about future meetups with a general timeframe indicative that he may actually want to meet up again, or is the lack of a more specific plan a sign he was just being polite while trying to leave?",t2_yve7f,False,,0,False,I (INFJ) had a first hangout (date?) with an ESTJ yesterday - not sure what to think,[],r/ESTJ,False,,,0,,False,t3_17om0w6,False,light,0.72,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question/Advice,False,3,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1699219211.0,text,,,,text,self.ESTJ,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please help out this overthinking, overanalyzing INFJ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve messaged for 2 months (due to temporary distance; sending 1-2 long messages each per week) and finally met up yesterday. We met through overlapping social circles, not a dating site or anything like that. He recommended the meetup and chose the day. He acknowledged that I&amp;#39;d said I was quite shy and he let me choose the location/activity from a list of options he provided (I believe for my comfort). We agreed to a walk along the river (scenic route) and I let him know he could bring his dog (which he did). There was never any indication as to whether this was just a friendly hang or a date/predate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked for two hours and had some good laughs. I gained better clarity into his interests and also the many things going on in his life (definitely a busy man!). He shared with me that he has ADHD and talked about things he is working towards (buying a new house, starting a business, etc). I&amp;#39;m quite worried that I was way too quiet, which happens to me when I meet new people. It&amp;#39;s as if my brain goes blank. As such, I feel like the conversations didn&amp;#39;t go as well as they could have (entirely my fault). Hopefully he understands it is just the shyness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very end, he gave me a quick hug and said that we&amp;#39;d have to get together again and mentioned that he&amp;#39;d be back in the area in 2-3 weeks for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. This was all said quite quickly and as he turned and walked to his car he called back &amp;quot;talk soon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t able to gauge body language well as we were briskly walking for the full 2 hours and only paused briefly at our cars at the end (he had his dog to handle, who is very energetic haha). With the lack of body language info and my conversational struggles, I am filled with doubt about how this went and whether he meant what he said at the end about meeting up or was just being polite.

,ESTJ,"My ESTJ spouse has been emotionally abusive for years but not very often. He recently suddenly escalated to physical when my son tried on my prom dress for Halloween.

,ESTJ,"Hello~ 

So I wanted an opinion because I’m very fascinated in mbti and everything and thought asking this here would make the most sense. 

I’ve been seeing this ESTJ guy for 2 months and change now, and we communicate via a messaging app in Korea, throughout the day. He messages me “good morning” and will ask me if slept well/got to work okay/ate well/ etc and I’m just unsure of what to make of this dynamic. 

I was sick and he bought me premium tangerines and shipped them to my house during our conversation which was thoughtful. 

The first time we met, we had really passionate and great sex. If I wrote a book about it, it would be a top seller for sure. Anyways, after our first meeting, our schedules became so complicated and we couldn’t see each other until 6 weeks later. When we saw eachother the 2nd time, he saw me (drove 1 hour there and back for a quickie and chat about 40mins~) during his overtime and went back to work. 

He went on a boys trip with his friends and he updated me about everything that he did throughout his trip and sent pictures all day long to me which I thought was cute.

But I have had too many difficult experiences, with my perceived experience of your:

1. refusal to try and see things from another's perspective.

3. dismissing something as ""nonsense"" when you know you don't even understand it (to know if it is nonsense or not)
4. when you do something bad to someone else, it's a ""non issue"" but when someone does something to you, you dwell.. so much so you bring it up years later... and keep bringing it up

So my question is, do you feel empathy (the imagined understanding of someone else's rationale or emotional circumstance)?

Note: I don't think it makes you evil to not be able to have empathy, it would be like being mad that it's cold outside and snowing.

Hello everyone.I have a friend whom I think might be an ESTJ.We have recently started talking about some random things at school.But today we have agreed to talk on what I think of him as a person.To be honest most of the talks we have are small talks which don't really reveal to me much about him and so I don't really have a clue.Therefore I would appreciate some insights from actual ESTJs and not sources online.

Here's some reasonings for why I think he is an ESTJ:
Te:He's a surface level thinker.I know it sounds bad but what I am trying to say is that when he thinks he considers many options at once.The downside is that he doesn't really reach a deep level of understanding.For example,he knows a lot of people but when I ask him about them,he can tell me several facts without really having a grasp of their personality.Also he recently asked me what I think of some classmates in my class.I told him that I don't really know them and I need some time to analyze and have a lot of deep and meaningful conversations with them.He said that it's not necessary and he can tell what someone is like just from a conversation.

Si:He shows a preference for old ways and knowledge.He has just got back into a game after several years of not playing so his playstyle is pretty old-fashioned.Everyone is just yelling at him,trying to make him relearn how to play the game but his old playstyle is still somewhat working for him so he refuses to.Additionally,he has a lot of respect for social structures and he does step up to take charge when my class is disorganized and feels directionless.He has been teaming up with other people to organize events for my class.

Ne:He can listen to others and accept new perspectives.He can be quite stubborn at times but it's tolerable.

Fi:I don't know if I should bring this up but he has had a crush on a girl for two years and does nothing about it.I am not sure if he doesn't do anything because he can not understand his emotions or it's because he does not know what he wants to do but regardless he seems to struggle immensely with his own emotions and he has reached out to me for help.But this could be because he's young and inexperienced.

,ESTJ,"Until you are foiled by a minor detail haha?!? 

I work for a large corporation. I learned about a new program that I wanted to onboard while at an out of town Conference this weekend. I was REALLY EXCITED about it. I remember telling the outside vendors...I will *definitely* make this happen! Fast forward to today I finally get to see my ENTJ Director who's been out of reach at meetings the last two days and leaving for a two week international vacation tomorrow (wanted to get things rolling before she left). I wanted to do this at the office vs email because I knew I would be more effective in person. I also talked to another director (INTJ) who's tech -savvy and I get them both on board (I knew I would be successful). I love working with other Doers. 

I send out a bunch of emails, fill out an annoyingly detailed request for IT support, &amp; communicate with outside vendor that I have got the wheels turning woohoo (he's probably surprised at my intense efforts). I am *totally* in a groove. I knew that there would be some legal permissions to overcome. I try to download said legal addendum, but get denied by tight security restrictions.

&lt;p&gt;I work for a large corporation. I learned about a new program that I wanted to onboard while at an out of town Conference this weekend. I was REALLY EXCITED about it. I remember telling the outside vendors...I will &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; make this happen! Fast forward to today I finally get to see my ENTJ Director who&amp;#39;s been out of reach at meetings the last two days and leaving for a two week international vacation tomorrow (wanted to get things rolling before she left). I wanted to do this at the office vs email because I knew I would be more effective in person. I also talked to another director (INTJ) who&amp;#39;s tech -savvy and I get them both on board (I knew I would be successful). I love working with other Doers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I send out a bunch of emails, fill out an annoyingly detailed request for IT support, &amp;amp; communicate with outside vendor that I have got the wheels turning woohoo (he&amp;#39;s probably surprised at my intense efforts). I am &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt; in a groove. I knew that there would be some legal permissions to overcome. I try to download said legal addendum, but get denied by tight security restrictions. I literally find ways to get through all of my obstacles...Te and Ne just barrel through everything. I send out emails to get assistance to start legal stuff tomorrow.

,ESTJ,"Heyyyy.  Not sure how active this place is, but just curious to hear some of your experiences with “relaxing” and making time for yourself. I’m concerned my mom doesnt make enough time to enjoy herself. Or how to.

my Mother seems to always stretch herself thin and even voluntarily makes more work for herself (sometimes as a control thing).  Last summer I stayed with her and my stepdad while I was home from Grad School and i noticed she basically is always busy, and when she’s not, she somehow finds a way to stay busy. She’s a lawyer who works from home, but has all these other side jobs, family obligations with her mom, etc) I don’t understand this and wanted to hear some perspective

There were times my ESFP stepdad and i were hanging out on our laptops in the living room and she would be so ON at 11 at night just doing all this stuff around the house and walked back and forth so much within 30 min that my stepdad and I started to get anxious and just sat there laughing without having to say what we were laughing about LOL.  And the weirdest part is, whenever i proactively tried to get in there and help or take over, she would be pushy about not wanting me to do it bc she likes it done right away and exactly how she wants. I started doing my own laundry when she wasnt home bc i felt too guilty. But then she will also play the martyr later when she says she’s pooped, and starts listing off all the things she accomplished that day in a lowkey humble brag tone.

,ESTJ,"LONG POST INCOMING. It’s literally like he (34M) came out of my (25F) dreams or something. But being with him is a huge decision which you’ll find out why later… I’m a really really extroverted INFJ (but definitely 100% INFJ) and I met my ESTJ at work (we’re both teachers!!). 

We met 2 months ago when school started randomly getting iced tea in the cafeteria. I said hi to be polite and I can’t even remember what happened but he just interested me so much. He was so stoic and professional but he gets this look in his eyes of softness when he’s learning something or curious. At first, he seemed so unsure about sharing things about himself with me, but loved hearing me speak about my life and ideas.

He opened up pretty quickly the more I kept popping in to see him, I kept coming during our planning periods or lunch breaks to his classroom hahaha. We could talk for hours about anything. We texted and called whenever we could, met whenever we could. He eventually shared he had been divorced from a toxic marriage and has a 7 year old daughter with shared custody. He said he didn’t mention it immediately cause he is very private about that stuff for safety reasons. 

Yeah… that hit me like a bomb… I thought things were going way too perfect, there had to be a catch. I’ve never hit any of those big milestones in my life. He said they have a system for their daughter and he filed and been done with her for years and she is engaged to someone else. So I trust his word but I was so bothered cause I couldn’t believe I was considering being with someone who did the things I really valued as my/our “first times”. I never ever thought I’d consider dating someone who was already married , let alone have a child. 


I really wrestled with that in my mind for weeks. We had a big talk last week about my insecurities, my problems, my fear of him feeling jaded and not wanting to commit again cuz he already got other commitments. He assured me he wants to commit again and have a gf/eventual wife to come home to and I shouldn’t even worry rn about being a stepmom etc.  cause he can financially and emotionally provide for his kid. 

I’m still nervous for the future but he makes me feel so safe and comfortable, I can’t imagine turning him down now when every day all I find are more reasons to like him. He thinks about me all the time (in a lovey dovey way) and he says it’s heavy for him cuz he isn’t used to that, I know he’s surely an ESTJ but I was so surprised he is falling for me so fast too, he said it must really mean something special cuz that’s not common for him.

I’m honestly so head over heels for this man, he cares so much about my acts of service, he admires and respects me so much, he is so open minded and emotionally intelligent and shares with me all the ways he teaches himself to control his emotions so that he can take care of his mental health. It’s so cute, he makes little promises to himself to never get mad about little things again, like people eating his food from the fridge over the years. Omg it’s so freakin cute 

He’s so good, it’s hard to think of walking away. We are exclusive but not official yet, he told me he will take me to a surprise restaurant in a week after the break (and I hope he asks me to be his girlfriend cuz we already know we want to be serious!!) I’ve never had a guy plan and take me to a restaurant, I know it’s normal but I feel like I don’t deserve it. I’m still nervous about stepping into this but I don’t wanna run away cuz what if I miss out on something great???

,ESTJ," I am an INTP, was homeschooled, and while I loved it I felt like there was something missing with no one to really mentor me in my scientific interests.  Now I have an ESTJ little girl who loves doing hands on things (I hate doing hands on things), and I know I need to do more to support her interests.

She's in 4th grade.  She can light a fire, cook most of our meals, and we have chickens she enjoys taking care of.  When she's at grandma's she sews and crafts up a storm, but we live farther away now so visits are infrequent.  She dreams a lot about the future - running a preschool or babysitting when she's a teen, building her own little cabin (mostly dwelling on the interior decorating), and having a farm.  She also starts planning birthday parties about a year in advance.  I think if I got her into theater and set design she would excel.  She'll say things like, if I turn this book into a TV show, I'd use this particular song for this scene, like she can somehow picture the whole thing.

Even though she has poured through every cookbook and craft book we have, she wants to order a school-related box kit for cooking that gets mailed in monthly.  I think it goes beyond the excitement of getting something in the mail.  Can someone please explain to me why you would want to do an activity that someone else designs and tells you how and what to do, instead of picking your own recipe from a cookbook?  

Our academics are pretty open-ended, and I'm not sure if that works best for her, but I don't know what would be optimal.  I'm hoping if someone can explain what makes an assigned cooking kit more attractive than baking whatever you want, I will have the missing piece...  I'm torn between believing she needs more structure and group activities in a day, and her disliking anything I tell her to do, maybe because I need to change my teaching style and come up with some learning-related projects.  But why wouldn't coming up with her own projects be good enough?  That's where I don't quite get it.

Homeschoolong can be quite flexible so I have no doubt that we will eventually optimize homeschooling to something she will thrive in.  For me if I understand how something works than I can do it.  So someone please tell me how her little brain works, and I'll be set. :D.

,ESTJ,"Hello guys. I've been wondering which Mbti type I am and I relate to these two a lot after a full year of observing myself and gathering information from people about me.

I noticed that I have pretty high Te. I always got called impatient and want to finish things fast so I can move on to the next task I have in mind. I do not like unnecessary things that waste my time such as people complaining about something that could be fixed or just ignored easily etc.

I also don’t give up if something goes wrong, Of course I question myself and my abilities a little to the point I may even doubt my decisions but I always believe that I can learn from my mistakes for the future and that there are many possibilities that can fix things or bring us to a different path in life,

I like to be prepared for things and tend to ‘panic’ in ways of anger or raising my voice if I lack details for example for a meeting. I like to have all all my questions solved to prepare myself from the unknown so yeah uncertainty was always a big anxiety factor for me.

I am good at observing people. For example their body language. I never had a partner but I know a log just by observing other people’s relationships and I give a lot of advice for life to my bestfriend. I just have to look at a person to know what kind of person they are. Some say I am like a psychic? But for me it’s just connection the dots of many years of observation.

My sister is an INFP and my mother would always say that I am the leading, logical type while my sister is the emotional one.

Many agreed with my “leading personality” and being “dominant”. I didnt know that I got seen that way,

my best friend says I am pretty logical too but they like my advice and support.

I love to help people I care about so I always make sure to be prepared with my best friend. I make sure that they eat well and aren’t lonely. I just show love through service.

My childhood was emotionally a bit rough so now I am treating people with more kindness and openness. I make sure everyone feels understood, seen, involved and loved. If I was a leader I would be a very people oriented one that respects and observes everyones strengths and weaknesses and eventually acts how it fits each individual.

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know who I am but I am slowly figuring things out.

I take things literally and can sometimes come across as dense.

I get confused when people say something but then do the opposite. I follow rules so why do people not follow them?

I am female and 21  years old.

I never had good grades in school, just average, because I simply put no effort into studying. School was a rough time for me and I began skipping it at high school because I isolate myself when I am sad and have no support system.

I am a student now in my third year

I am open for other appropriate questions or even mbti suggestions, if you noticed something.

,ESTJ,"Hi ESTJs,

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR,

As a person who is on the receiving hand of the grudge with an unhealthy ESTJ, how can I get out of this?? Also, how can I make them not see me a rival just because I exist? I am the least competitive person on earth.

I was right he was wrong but I still want to be on friendly terms.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story:

I had a fall out with an unhealthy ESTJ at work (enneagram 3 with strong 8 in tritype). They were very nice to me in the beginning because they thought they could benefit from me, I sensed this all along but it was okay - I mean they were nice in the end, and then they had a change of mind because now they believe I am a rival. Literally, a more authoritative figure put this in their mind that only one of us could exist. This is not true by the way but he wants to have it all. This led to arguments because well, - unhealthy ESTJ-, but also he was wrong and I was right and he knows I am right but he wants his own way, and it has come spilling that he never treated me as an equal. He just used my name to get projects, and then basically left me out on them. The first argument was bad, he had to comply but never acknowledged this in talks, he did not have a follow-up chat, no apology.

After a while, I pretended it didn't happen and went back to being friendly but cautious because I was on good terms with his wife too but of course, he was tense and annoyed around me, like you feel that even when he is faking he is so tense. I felt relieved in a way because felt relieved and free. Then came another argument because he literally just tried to do the same thing, basically saw that he needed to add me to a project as there was no way around it but this time his target was actually to get someone else to work with them, and get them in the project. I confronted him and asked what had changed his mind, but only asked this when we all met, and he basically had a short fuse and got super argumentative. Afterwards said I was not right to bring it up in front of others, but he was the one who invited me to the meeting and had no talks to address the former situation.

So basically he is argumentative, callous, super mega competitive, and I am not even in the game. He also said shocking things to me before, like how he doesn't care about clients and they can go to hell, bragged about having others do the work for him, and said he never does technical work anymore, but around others, he goes and brags about how he cares about clients, and how the clients come to him to say thank you, says he basically couldn't live if he didn't get to do the technical part and that he was offered a lot of money but he turned down those job offers blah blah. I know he has had these problems at his past workplace too and almost had his career ended but I was nice to him then when not all were. I also covered for him at times. Also has been described as working like a maniac by former colleagues even when I didn't ask about it, it is crazy how competitive he is. Seconded from his wife as well.

Now it is clear we can't work together, but it bothers me that he is always so tense and furious, and as stupid as this is I want to get on good terms and keep his wife as a friend and the friend circle we share. - He can keep friends only if they are working on different topics (read no rival). He can do what he wants because everything has to be ""his way, get his name"" apparently, I just don't want to be on his radar. I am not being competitive with him and I don't think he has any reason to believe this. I am a person who sabotages myself, all my wars are with myself and I am chill and even lazy at work, I have trouble concentrating - it is painful. It is true that I get some things fall in line for me, not because I work hard but because I see the bigger picture and am good with people. I am not in any way competitive and I wish he would stop seeing me as a rival.

Is there hope? How should I go about it? Apology is out of the question, I was right but that is not the point. Just want to be on good terms. I feel that he may like me as a rival, keeps him fueled and what not. Wish it had the same effect on me.",t2_b2qvlf03,False,,0,False,Unhealthy ESTJ colleague/friend - how to get back on good terms,[],r/ESTJ,False,,,0,,False,t3_16658qo,False,light,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question/Advice,False,2,,False,False,,1693471421.0,,[],{},,True,,1693470462.0,text,,,,text,self.ESTJ,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi ESTJs,&lt;/p&gt;

,ESTJ,"Hello! It's been a few years since I've been following a Brazilian influencer in computer science, who I now realize is an ESTJ. The thing is, many people don't like him and his content for a few reasons.

\- He's extremely practical and straightforward in his manner.

They had a lot of things to say about questions like ""Are you sailing your own course?"" - Messaged me with questions like, ""What does that mean? Doesn't everyone sail their own course?"" 

Seemed a pretty straightforward question to me. 

Then, ""Obviously I sail my own course. But is it a course I like? Is it a course I want to be on?"" 

They read a bit about INFJ and said ""I recognize myself in some of it but it just seems too artistic for me. Also some of the things just seem too serious (the things INFJ want to achieve in life, e.g. leading people): 

""Seriously? I'm not Ghandi."" 

Then we went over ISTJ - they looked over some characteristics and had to say the following thing: 

""Decisive? Absolutely not."" 

""Cares about the rules? Couldn't care less unless I'm going to jail for it."" 

""Insensitive to others? In my head, yes, but I would never let that show. I always cater to other people's feelings and do everything in my power to ensure that everyone around me is happy with a certain decision even if I don't agree myself - even if it makes me really upset, because I hate making others uncomfortable. I'd rather have me miserable than someone else."" (Wow?) 

""They fail to pick up on the emotional signals given by other people? I'm very good at picking up emotional signals which ties back to the need to ensure that everyone is happy around me. If we're in a group setting and someone says something that hurts someone else, but they don't show it - I will always pick up on that, so I would say I'm good at reading people."" 

""This personality also seems to efficient and productive. I feel like I procrastinate too much for that. But otherwise the key characteristics I very much agree with."" 

Also gave me some examples of their behaviour: 

""When cooking everything has to be perfect, and after every step everything has to be cleaned. I have to have a plan and execute it well, otherwise it becomes meaningless and I just want to give up.""

""When watching a movie I get upset when others aren't watching as attentively as I am, and aren't analyzing every scene and trying to understand the characters. I hate it when someone picks up their phone while we're watching.""

I figure their Fe must be quite high. They also show a lot of Te, I think. Possibly an example is that, instead of pursuing her passions, they focus more on benefits and a path that guarantuees long term profit.

So, again, we already went over ISTJ which they say is too strategic and productive, and INFJ they say is too artistic and people-focused. Definitely not a lot of Se or Ne either. When I gave them a list of characteristics they checked off INFJ, INTJ, ENTJ, ISTJ and ISTP. And with temperaments they go for SJ and NT.

,ESTJ,"MBTI Theory may or may not lack a proper scientific base but since studying cognitive functions, I've found them to be able to near-perfectly explain why and how I do almost anything and how my brain works.

Then again, that could just be my Ti brain ending up making placebo-forced connections (since I can rationalize anything) and I might've even made those if I looked up the wrong function set. Although that last statement already assumes I use Ti in the first place which is just circular reasoning... yeah nvm...

MBTI basically got me out of the ""everyone must think like me"" belief and I found out that not everyone values logic over emotion or tradition etc. I wondered then if this could be a way to figure out someone's motives, values, and thought processes (to know where they're coming from) so as to not look at everything as black or white

So basically I wanted to get multiple perspectives on this:

Do you relate to your type's functions? And if so is it more than other functions?

Do you think it's a placebo or not? Did you know something about your thought process that clicked when you read a certain function?

Do the function definitions explain why and how you live your life and do certain things?

Please elaborate as much as you can.

I&amp;#39;m not an empath, but I can sense &amp;#39;vibes&amp;#39;. I didn&amp;#39;t always trust my instincts until the last few years (Ni Trickster), but now I&amp;#39;m sure that I have sensed sadness, anxiety, and other emotions from my friends/fam. Does any other ESTJ or Sensor have relatable experiences? I have heard similar things from others in this Sub and one of my close female ESTJ friends (we both have developed Fi), but I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s our general population. Please discuss. TIA.&lt;/p&gt;

,ESTJ,"I've seen other posts about this in the past but too bad. [16personalities.com](http://16personalities.com/) and some people say Gordon Ramsay is an ENTJ but I don't buy it and a lot of other people think he's an ESTJ as well.

Feel free to share your thoughts!

He's very particular and has strong opinions about how things should be done, he seems to have strong Si because he cares a lot how a dish tastes and is passionate about food. Also ESTJs and ENTJs talk very differently, it's hard to explain. I might not agree with what an ESTJ says but it's not over my head. And he may seem like a visionary but I think he could have achieved what he has through hard work, self-improvement, and learning and trying new things, rather than having worked toward some goal in the future. 

I hate that he swears so much, yet as someone who works in hospitality I relate to him in some ways. I know you can't completely judge his personality by his shows (I've watched a couple interviews too but have never met him of course). But as an example there was an episode where he finally gives up on a hotel owner because a 20-year-old server was able to tell the chicken was dry, but he said, ""It's raw"".  I think an ENTJ would rely more on their intuition and not point to a specific example like that, yet he always seems to have an example when he makes a point. And I totally relate to this because I get annoyed when people who have done their jobs for years don't seem to know what they're doing, because they do something that might seem little to others, but to me it's a red flag. Of course, I make those kinds of mistakes as well and am hard on myself too, whether or not it's right.

He has a good sense of humor sometimes but anyone can have a sense of humor so I hesitate to say that's because he's an ESTJ. He's mean sometimes (which is possibly just for dumb American TV) but is relatively polite to employees and others and this video of him ""actually being nice"" is very wholesome: [https://youtu.be/xXK0iNRbKZk](https://youtu.be/xXK0iNRbKZk) ",t2_aubclyxa,False,,0,False,I think Gordon Ramsay's an ESTJ,[],r/ESTJ,False,,,0,,False,t3_157kce3,False,light,0.84,,public,4,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion/Poll,False,4,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1690132430.0,text,,,,text,self.ESTJ,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen other posts about this in the past but too bad. &lt;a href=""http://16personalities.com/""&gt;16personalities.com&lt;/a&gt; and some people say Gordon Ramsay is an ENTJ but I don&amp;#39;t buy it and a lot of other people think he&amp;#39;s an ESTJ as well.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve posted this in other subs as well but really interested in what you ESTJs think about this!

I’m trying to help my ISTJ mom release anger from the past. She is physically ill because of it. We are unsure how to process her anger. Her entire life, she has actively downplayed emotions, avoiding arguments / bottling everything. She feels deeply wronged by someone and even after 20 years, feels troubled by it.  

She’s also hyper realistic and asks if there’s even a point to expressing the anger (because the person passed away &amp; she cannot get closure). She also doesn’t want to cause disharmony to people around us by complaining. 

I’m kind of lost as to how to help her get catharsis and how to explain to her the importance of getting it out. I’m not good at emotions myself. 

I’ve listened to her vent the same things a lot and am happy to listen to more. 

1. Does venting the same things over and over make you feel better? 
2. Does anyone here have ideas on activities that gives *SATISFACTION*. Maybe stuff like writing letters, yelling at the top of the mountain etc. I think it’d be super fun to do it with her, I could probably use it too
3. What works for you? How do you heal from emotions? How does it work?

,ESTJ,"Curious as to whether anyone else is in a similar situation or is familiar with such a relationship. 

I’ve been with my boyfriend for four years (I’m a late-30s ESTJ woman; he’s an early-50s ESFJ man). We have a great partnership, but not much emotional or other intimacy. He takes care of the home, does the dishes, gardens, cleans, and cares for our dog while I am at work. He is very set in his ways, but far more feelings-oriented than I am.

I am much more direct and thinking-oriented rather than feelings-oriented, the latter of which I struggle with. Hence, our communication often suffers. I’m also admittedly not that great or interested in doing chores. I enjoy work, as does he (I’m in a quality program management/engineering position, and have been with my company for 15 years; he works in the restaurant industry — and we contribute equally to finances; I am the homeowner but he owns another property he rents out). But when I get home, I just want to relax, and that causes some conflict as he feels (understandably) like he’s always the caregiver of our home. We also sleep in separate rooms; I’m a night owl and he is an early bird. 

Before Covid hit, I used to go to happy hour all the time after work, but rarely do so these days. I work outside of the home by choice, as I derive energy from being around other people, even if it’s just walking through the main office to get to mine and having a few in-person meetings (though I do the best work on my own afterward and trust myself best to get the job done).

Hello my friends! This is a request for some of your advice and thoughts (from a 25m ENFP). 

I am in the U.S born &amp; raised n currently in the middle of a formal more traditional courtship process (typical timeline goes as follows: connect via friends recommending we’d be a match, text, calls, video calls etc then if things go well connect with her family and move forward from there. Can go from a few weeks to a few months process) with a 25f ESTJ. We have been talking for a few weeks now and we surprisingly have a lot of similar interests, similar career goals, similar religious beliefs, generally similar fields (although she has much higher education than me and is much further in the field 😆 classic ESTJ behavior which I am happy for her for hahaha she is very hardworking). So at a high level I would say that most things are solid + I am attracted to her from what I’ve seen pictures &amp; her for me as well. I understand this is pretty left field compared to the typical western 

I have a few concerns and I’m not sure if they are valid or if I’m just in over my head with my assumptions regarding her and her personality so far. From our convos and talking I’ve learned from her and from some of her friends whom I’ve inquired about her for that she is a pretty blunt and to the point person as well as that she doesnt really know how to express her emotions too well in some ways/scenarios. And this makes sense to me to a level due to her cognitive stacking with NeFi as the weaker and TeSi main &amp; how she’s just always been to the point, efficiency, getting things done, never been in a romantic relationship etc. Not to say she’s not kind and a good person, she very much is so based on her actions/involvement in community etc— but I bring this up bc as an ENFP (completely opposite ordered cognitive stacking as her hahaha) I am very much a heavy feeler and expresser of emotions, and I would love to be able to receive a lot from my partner whatever it is physical touch, words of affirmation etc but I am worried that these things are so foreign to her and giving is so normal for me &amp; the relationship would end up being one sided even if she was into me just due to the way she currently is. I say currently bc I know people can grow and love grows, compromises made for eachother, extra steps you take for the ones you love etc but I just feel weird thinking about our dynamic in the long run lol ENFP &amp; ESTJ but I do know that I really like her. (I know the functions and categories are not just slap a stick and boom that’s what you are but I am just letting my mind wander which is not always the most productive thing🥲) I am no scholar or organized like many SJ’s are but I have definitely proactively worked hard on and continue to work on being more organized, disciplined and routine just for my own personal development and businesses. 

Alongside that during our calls she has noted that she appreciates directness/not beating around the bush so I’ve followed suit when it comes to certain questions/topics and im just straight about them. Occasionally she tells me she enjoys talking to me (after I ask how she’s feeling) &amp; we are laughing having a good time connecting etc but I still feel a bit off lol not sure if it’s my anxious attachment or what as majority of the time it’s like a 70/30 split skewed my way I’d say when it comes to us asking eachother questions/posing things to talk about. When we start talking then we keep it rolling very easily and naturally flows tho. I get it that the guy usually takes the lead but it’s really hard for me get a read on her lol. We plan on meeting up in person soon, but prior to that we are still in this stage lol I’m not a fan of this stage in general but it has to be gone thru.

,ESTJ,"This is just a reminder to my fellow ESTJs that we are awesome. I'm a 20 year old guy, and the pull to disassociate with who I know I am is very tempting, to think of myself as an ""intuitive"", to stretch the truth just a bit and live a lie. But I can't, and sometimes I find myself wanting to indulge that feeling of self growth and improvement, but alas, the lack of content for ESTJs and general disdain we face online tears me up inside. I really like this community centered around typology, but I have a hard time parsing out ""who"" I should listen to (Fe) instead of ""what"" content is credible or not. That's a big downside. The worst thing is knowing that my Ni is non-existent, getting whooped in the derriere for three consecutive games of chess by an ESTP in front of both mine and the ESTP's mutual crush.

""Why not try and improve my Ni??? If I get enough input as to how it works, I can reverse engineer it with Ne and map out linear contingencies with Si, thus producing a similar result."" The aforementioned thought process has been eating at my brain recently. Reverse engineering Ni would open many doors for calculative behavior, but for my ESTP friend's case, I would have to do the same thing with Ti, and I'm not sure that the end result would be worth my time and energy.

If we naturally take our own functions for granted, and the typology community generally has negative inputs for our own type, then generally speaking there's a high probability that many of us are not going to feel very good about ourselves. I'm doing what I can to change that by posting things like this and getting my thoughts out into writing to help me process things.

On a lighter note, most people I talk to who have a rudimentary understanding of typology (I'm talking 16p here) typically say I'm highly intelligent and then type me as an intuitive. This gives more credence towards me wanting to live a lie and go with the flow so to speak but if I'm being honest with myself I take in information abundantly in a more exploratory intuitive sense, reaching the farthest corners of the internet/books (Ne) and find the solids in the info soup with which to make trajectory based calculations via Si.

I do want to preface my statement about intelligence with how I believe it works for Si-Ne users. For me, I have to go to the info, input it into my brain via taking notes/reading and go through the process of systematically using the info in a sort of formulaic way (Like algebra/calculus) and then finally seeing how that process can be congruent or different from other processes I've used, splicing them together and sectioning them off to make new ones. That happens with all types of info, and those processes are stored with a recall-rate of 70-80% in my case (guesstimated).

So I guess that leads me to the thought that I sometimes feel as if I was just a robot, but I know that's not the case. I do my very best to understand people and how they operate (going as far as to learn Socionics) and I'm just sometimes bummed that people are ok with such a rudimentary understanding of typology.

,ESTJ,"INTP wife here who is trying to be more helpful. I'm definitely not the best MBTI type to support and help my husband as I've been encouraging his tertiary Ne and he has become a multitasking monster with 10 different projects open, unwilling to narrow them down and putting himself in a rut because of overwork. And the few times I've tried to encourage him to prioritize projects he ends up with even more projects... If not for his dom Te and inferior Fi I would have labeled him an ENTP with how scattered he is right now. He is so focused on trying to start a business but can't commit to one thing. He is wasting all of his energy by not planning things through. 

How should I go about this? I'm guessing he is in a TeNe loop and I have no idea how to break him out of it. What would you guys prefer your partner do to support you through times like these?

,ESTJ,"Hello hello, ENFP here 👋

I hope you guys are doing well in your subreddit. Randomly mentioning you guys’ type, I am once again reminded of how great you guys can be. The dynamic ENFP-ESTJ isn’t the most common, but although challenging, it is still a workable, fruitful relationship when both parties put the work (like anything, BUT we share the same functions! *slay*)

My grandma is an ESTJ. For the longest time, I viewed her as “stuck in her ways”, “annoying-nagging”, “inconsiderate” and “mocking of others”. Depending on how you look at it, some of her flaws are still present, but there is **so much more** than that. She’s a very caring person, never fails to help the family financially and practically when she can (and even when she really can’t, she does it anyway). Her ‘old ways’ are just habits of how she feels *comfort* in doing things. There isn’t anything outdated with it, as long it matters to her. The nagging is just because she pushes you to become a better person and do what you must to succeed. Or how things could be done more effectively, yikes!

Even though it looks like she’s inconsiderate, she pays attention deeply to others, only it doesn’t show on the surface that she cares about you or prizes something that has been done. Thank you grandma.

Thank you, French teacher and Arts teacher for complaining that we students should do more and not be lazy, study harder and be the best self as we can become. Thank you for explaining things in different ways a thousand times for us, dumb bastards *that sometimes couldn’t care less about your subject*. All your effort is being appreciated now. *forces all classmates to bow down magically*

And thank **each of you** for being who you are, regardless of the many people that have called you insensitive/boring/stubborn/judgmental/serious/perfectionist. Truth is, they couldn’t see past your true intentions and well-meaning.

&lt;p&gt;And thank &lt;strong&gt;each of you&lt;/strong&gt; for being who you are, regardless of the many people that have called you insensitive/boring/stubborn/judgmental/serious/perfectionist. Truth is, they couldn’t see past your true intentions and well-meaning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let live and move on. You’ll find more worthwhile people that will value you if you already haven’t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good day everyone and thank you for taking time to read this🙏⭐️💜&lt;/p&gt;

Honest question. He is one of the funniest people I know, and not just in the sarcastic, dry, according-to-my-Te-you're-dumb kind of way, but also goofy, playful etc. Most people who know him would label him 'the-funny-one' *way* before they will 'the-bossy-one'. And the way I see it, with your sharp Te and your playful Ne most of you estjs must be a bit like that too, or at the very least, very sarcastic (which seems to be attributed to intjs/istps more often).

He is quite the estj though - blunt, efficient, task-oriented, *stubborn*. But also so funny and easy-going.

So, the question is, is he the odd one out or do you all value humor quite a lot? And if my assumption is correct and you're all quite funny, how come *this* fact never sticks but the rest of the stupid cliches about you do?

,ESTJ,"Hey

The past couple of years I've been reading about mbti, cognitive functions, and taken tests. Ive gotten these types as results, xntj, xstj,and xstp. 

I was reluctant to even ask in an stj group as I read constantly that they are strict rule followers and I'm not...however I'm constantly compared to my mom (stj) and my wife after reading about types says xstj is the closest in her opinion.

The only thing for sure I know is that I'm an xxTx. Not sure if Te or Ti as I tend to get a split on these and I relate to both. 

Based off these generic answers what would you say the type is

Planner or improvisers

I'm flexible. I prefer planning but can be flexible if things come up. Overall all I want is that I'M the one who chooses and dictates what I do.

Practical or abstract

Both

Structured or unstructured environments

Structured

Do you frequently do things without a specific schedule or plan.

I want the freedom to choose to have a schedule or not. I do have a loose morning routine and I do my best to not have it interrupted. I dislike having things sprung upon me.

Do you think rules and regulations are necessary

Yes, the ones that make sense

5 words to describe myself(this is from close friends/loved ones)

Persistent/Determined

Confident

Rebellious

Impatient

Physical

I like to face problems head on

I stay objective when making decisions

No problem confronting others

I think about the present and how it'll affect the future

I like to understand the framework being used to make a decision

I cannot stand being micro managed

I do not like needy people

Been described as a Jock/nerd combo

I weightlift 5 days a week, hike, surf etc

Used to play baseball, hockey, BMX, and heavily into skateboarding when I was younger

I've been a nerd/geek my whole life(you wouldn't know it by looking at me) Big into video games, tabletop rpg DnD.(Usually play as an Ranger ) I like to read sci fi, fantasy, and horror. Used to write but have no time now. Star Trek nerd. Walking encyclopedia of Horror movie trivia

Love music, big part of me. Specifically punk and metal and even more specifically death,power,symphonic. But I enjoy soundtracks, lo fi, instrumentals also

I'm a very loyal dedicated person to those close to me

I'm goofy and loving toward my wife and kids. I like to joke around and make them laugh

I have a movie room I made

I dont like being late to work or appointments. Something my parents instilled in me.(moms an istj, dad's an isfj, and sis is an estj) I butted heads with them constantly and still do. There conservatives religious, I'm liberal and athiest

Logic/Rational minded

Ambitious and always wanting to learn

Heavily into the tattoos and piercing scene

Worked retail jobs and never lasted. My job now is more being your own boss, do your thing, rarely managed. Best job so far

Blunt

Doer/Realist

I'm open minded

I ask why a lot, I want to know what I'm about to do make sense and not waste time 

I like make tier lists

,ESTJ,"ESTJs are definitely one of the most negatively stereotyped of the 16 personalities/cog function stacks. However, unlike the others, we never see ESTJs defending themselves in posts or posting things that defy their norms bc there’s so little of u on here. Also, unlike the other most negatively stereotyped MBTIs, I know none of u so I can’t point to an example of someone I know and say how they defy their stereotypes. 

In case you’re interested, here’s how friends of mine with negatively stereotyped MBTIs break their stereotypes:

ENTJ:
The ENTJs I’ve been close to defy the ENTJ stereotypes in so many ways, but if you ignore the stereotypes and focus on their cognitive functions, it couldn’t be more obvious. (They do still fit some stereotypes though, like they’re both very stubborn and can come off as controlling). They’re both two of the most artsy people I know, and one of them is a vegan hippie anarchist while the other is a butch emo stoner. 

ISTJ: 
The ISTJs I’ve been close to defy their stereotypes as well. Out of the 4 ISTJs I’ve been close to, only one was the slightest bit robotic. She did match the stereotypes in many ways, and in extreme amounts, but was also very quirky and a quiet anti-social emo kid. She also enjoyed art and writing. 2 of them were hella sassy, funny, and cool which is not ever described as an ISTJ and is kinda contradictory to the common stereotypes on here. The fourth ISTJ I’ve been close to (and dated..) is a doctor by day, and the biggest fuck boii (low-key chad vibes) by night. 

ESFJ: 
I can only think of two ESFJs I’ve been close to. Ig I’m not the kinda person to attract the popular &amp; basic kind of ESFJ or pop &amp; basic friend in general lol. Well actually they both were popular in their own way. One of them is a stripper. I was involved with her gf (they were poly). She was VERY popular with the men and her many adult friends adored her. But in her teenage years, she used to beat people up. She’s also a college drop out. The other ESFJ, is my long-time friend. She’s always been friends with the popular kids but an outcast weirdo at the same time. She also had a period in her childhood where she would beat people up. She even was sometimes aggressive with me when we were young (hair-pulling, hitting, shoving). She was also extremely controlling. She would bully my other best friend bc she wanted me to herself. My other best friend at the time (ISTP) found it hilarious though.

However, unlike the others, we never see ESTJs defending themselves in posts or posting things that defy their norms bc there’s so little of u on here. Also, unlike the other most negatively stereotyped MBTIs, I know none of u so I can’t point to an example of someone I know and say how they defy their stereotypes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you’re interested, here’s how friends of mine with negatively stereotyped MBTIs break their stereotypes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ENTJ:
The ENTJs I’ve been close to defy the ENTJ stereotypes in so many ways, but if you ignore the stereotypes and focus on their cognitive functions, it couldn’t be more obvious. (They do still fit some stereotypes though, like they’re both very stubborn and can come off as controlling). They’re both two of the most artsy people I know, and one of them is a vegan hippie anarchist while the other is a butch emo stoner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISTJ: 
The ISTJs I’ve been close to defy their stereotypes as well. Out of the 4 ISTJs I’ve been close to, only one was the slightest bit robotic. She did match the stereotypes in many ways, and in extreme amounts, but was also very quirky and a quiet anti-social emo kid. She also enjoyed art and writing. 2 of them were hella sassy, funny, and cool which is not ever described as an ISTJ and is kinda contradictory to the common stereotypes on here. The fourth ISTJ I’ve been close to (and dated..) is a doctor by day, and the biggest fuck boii (low-key chad vibes) by night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ESFJ: 
I can only think of two ESFJs I’ve been close to. Ig I’m not the kinda person to attract the popular &amp;amp; basic kind of ESFJ or pop &amp;amp; basic friend in general lol. Well actually they both were popular in their own way. One of them is a stripper. I was involved with her gf (they were poly). She was VERY popular with the men and her many adult friends adored her. But in her teenage years, she used to beat people up. She’s also a college drop out. The other ESFJ, is my long-time friend. She’s always been friends with the popular kids but an outcast weirdo at the same time. She also had a period in her childhood where she would beat people up. She even was sometimes aggressive with me when we were young (hair-pulling, hitting, shoving). She was also extremely controlling. She would bully my other best friend bc she wanted me to herself. My other best friend at the time (ISTP) found it hilarious though. However, in recent years, she has found god, and is now a very easy-going and nice person. lol.&lt;/p&gt;

I hate people.

I hate it when random morons keep interacting with me and disturb my daydreaming. People ALWAYS need help with something, and I don't wanna solve it (it's my job, I'm a front desk attendent/security guard in a luxury apartment complex, but I don't really care...?). How can I stop repressing my anger and tell people that I want them to piss off? How do I create red lines?

I want to focus on my own inner world, imagination, creativity. Not on helping people I don't even care about.

And when I'm home people constantly open the door to my room to talk to me about trivial nonsense (and the damn PROLOGUE! Get to the darn point, losers). It causes so much built up stress my brain goes numb and I feel like my heart is going to burst out of my throat. And by extention, that means it silences my creativity and train of thought along with any willingness to take action. It just doesn't stop. I'd live in a remote planet if I could. I can't stand it anymore.

A human within my vicinity = Instant wrath and anxiety

,ESTJ,"Hello estj's. If you care for a little read, I am in need of your advice, which i trust will be honest and perhaps blunt.

I (infj) have a friend of the opposite gender (e/istj) whom I've known for a decade now. He has always been dear to me, even through periods when we don't speak. We were lightly involved romantically as young teens, nothing serious. As older teens, we didn't go to the same school anymore so we texted every day for years. It almost felt like we were dating with how close we were at the time, yet no boundaries/labels were ever discussed.

Here's where the problem lies: During our older teen years we got \*too close\* over text and once coming to our senses, things became a tad awkward/difficult. We talked amicably and harmlessly for a few months until we both started college, and haven't talked since. He's somewhat out of touch with his emotions, so I never have a clear idea on where we stand (because he can't tell me).

My question: I still get concerned and care for him on some level, and would like to check on him. Should I text him? Should I resist and try my best to forget him? My motive is pure: I genuinely just want to hear what he's up to. I'm not tryna hit him up for anything weird.

I thought it could have to do with some kinda Fi thing..? Not sure.. honestly there are a lot of potential reasons for it but I’m just hoping to find it here or mark this off the list..

Other things that might be the reason is ADHD, Bc of hypersensitivity. But not sure if that explains why my social environment affects it

Im also 16, and female, so it could be hormones. But again, that still doesn’t explain it to me.. 

I think if it does have to do with MBTI then Fi grip? I’ve been crying a lot recently because of school stress and tend to get upset very very quickly with things like my friends conversations.. its pretty bad djsjjsjsjs

,ESTJ,"There's a lot to explain cause all details matter, but I don't wanna keep the night writing, so I'm gonna try to summarize, but I can extend if someone asks for a specific thing.


Currently 23yo.


From 12 - 16yo I was a romantic, feeling things a lot, my emotions were a roller coaster, I was feeling easy in love with college girls just cause ladies were paying attention to me or at least talking… I know it's sad, but I was being bullied, and I needed a bit of care, and I was desperate for someone to treat me well.


From 17-20yo I finish the mandatory studies and I change school to study IT. Having a new environment helps me a lot, cause ppl was now caring for me a bit more, and I was now the one rejecting talking with ppl cause I was so insecure and afraid of leaving the imaginary shield I did build during previous years and experiences. So I start eating healthier, studying something I like also helps me a lot and I start to make friends.


At 19yo, one of my new friends introduces me to calisthenics and I get in shape cause of that. (I'm doing calisthenics since then).


At 20yo, I start my internship in a company and besides all the technical knowledge I keep getting, I hear about cryptocurrency and being to learn about it with some of my internship colleges.


When I finish the internship, covid came and the company can't afford to hire me. So I spent the next 6 months studying cryptocurrency investment now buying a trading academy course and also BTC starts to go up so all my investments get a X3 minimum. I get crazy, I feel like a boss without knowing much about the economy cycles.


We are already at 21yo and I start working for another company as Junior Developer and doing investments as a side hustle, learning more about IT cause the company and learning cryptocurrency cause the trading academy I bought during covid.


At 22yo I got promoted to Analyst (no longer Junior) but my investments start going down as the market was crashing, and I just keep losing money, and I was doing the same things that were giving me money last year.


Anyway, I do wanna know more about self development as controlling your emotions is so important in investments and I start reading self-development books and I create this ""new"" personality where I'm trying to create good habits, keep the good ones, remove the bad ones, learn about communication skills, try to create a drop-shipping website which fails, learn about taxes and laws, while keeping doing calisthenics and eat healthy and rest well and trying to understand my investments, myself

and others.


I've been changing a lot mainly from 21yo to now and financial literacy, professional development, personal development and having healthier relationships with others have changed me so much that I think I'm no longer an ISFJ, as I was at 16yo, and now I'm a ESTJ.


I would like to know your opinion about if that's possible, or it's just my perception… Or even I might be either of those.


I've never paid much attention to the personality type, but I've realized it's a good next step to increase my knowledge about myself.

What are some principles you abide to, especially the non-negotiables?

What are you looking for in a relationship? How do you seek out/“test” your potential partner? 

Do you find yourself seeking a committed relationship or just date around? And are you one to be often found in a relationship or do you find yourself single more often? 

Do you find that your actual real life dating experience differs from what your philosophy/theory of dating is? 

Do you have any fears around dating?

I made a post before about my opinion about Te/Ti functions, and I'm trying to refine it until I reach to the most perfect, systematic, useful and practical understanding and definition for the whole cognitive functions, so here's my refined opinion about Te/Ti

T gives ""meaning"" to the gathered (perceived) informations, and this means that T give the ""reasons"" behind the gathered (perceived) informations

E/I indicate if these informations are given to (executed in) the outside world (Te), or stored in the mind in (the inside world) as a conclusion (Ti)

,ESTJ,"Here is a Spotify playlist of songs I relate to as an ESTJ and also really like, not all ESTJs will. I like making playlists because I have a high opinion of my taste in music lol, although maybe I should learn to stick to a genre. Below are the songs and explanations of why I added them.

Let me know what you think, thanks!

**Playlist** [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6trU2zPzv21qgzO9YEzSX7?si=f5a862ba7cf84ef2](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6trU2zPzv21qgzO9YEzSX7?si=f5a862ba7cf84ef2) 

**I Can’t Stand Still** Personally I’m happier when I’m busy, and I tend to do things fast.

**Wake Me Up** I related to this song when I was in high school and so ready to grow up and be more independent and start my career, though I didn’t know what I wanted to do until the year after high school. Also I relate to, “All this time I’ve been finding myself, and I didn’t know I was lost” I feel like we learn about ourselves as we get older.

**Almost There/I’ll Make a Man Out of You** Tiana, and Li Shang from Mulan are (fictional) ESTJs

**Go the Distance/High Hopes/Stronger** Motivational songs, also Go the Distance is very nostalgic

**Good Girl** “Why you gotta be so blind?” I feel bad for people in bad relationships but I don’t get why they put up with it. I’ve never been in a relationship though so take that with a grain of salt.

**Break My Heart/Ever Fallen in Love** I wouldn’t fall for a bad person but I can still have inconvenient feelings for someone, even if it’s not going to work out. 

**Alive/Rise** More motivational songs

**Superstition** I’m a Christian but I’m still healthily skeptical and try to think logically

**Non-Stop** Alexander Hamilton was supposedly an ENTJ, but close enough

**Don’t Rain on my Parade** Song about standing up for yourself

**Word Crimes** I do hate typos, I don’t generally correct people’s grammar or spelling though.

**Ain’t It Fun** You gotta grow up someday, kid (I’m 27 and I sound 80, oh well)

**My Kind of Love/Love Is Not a Fight** These songs are about love not being a feeling so much as an action, and being loyal to the other person.

**It’s Alright (Send Me)** Billy Graham was an ESTJ and this reminded me of him

**Running Just to Catch Myself** Funny song about working in an office setting (I do, but not in a negative environment like in the song)

**Hey Look Ma I Made It/Moving Out** Both of these are kind of about the negative side of success

**American Pie/Danger Zone** I had to include a couple of songs that just sound nostalgic and the lyrics don't fit the theme, I get nostalgic about songs that were written before I was born because of Si, I think.

**Dare You To Move/Do Something/Brave** Songs about motivating/helping others.

**My Way** Frank Sinatra was an ESTJ, and I don’t agree with the message of this song but it’s cool to see an ESTJ musician.

**Little Wonders** This song thaws my cold heart (jk, but it did make me tear up), I tend to stress out over small stuff but I also want to appreciate the little things that are positive. Side note the end of Meet the Robinsons, where the song is from, is my favorite movie ending ever.",t2_aubclyxa,False,,0,False,ESTJ Playlist!,[],r/ESTJ,False,,,0,,False,t3_12q5ign,False,light,1.0,,public,6,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Fun!,False,6,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681781953.0,text,,,,text,self.ESTJ,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a Spotify playlist of songs I relate to as an ESTJ and also really like, not all ESTJs will.

I've seen many explanation to Te, and These explanations makes contradictions(I'm not sure if my solutions are right or not, but the fact that these are problems and illogical contradictions is undeniable):

1.some say Te is ""what others think"" or it's ""understanding systems in the outside world"", and they ""look to the facts"" meaning that Te became a perceiving(gathering informations) function and not a judging function (which is completely wrong)

2.some say that Te is about making a strategy or plan, but I think that when you make strategies and plans, you perceive it more than judging it

3. judging and perceiving are the opposite of each other, and this is why when one of them increase, the opposite decrease in your test, so if one of them ""gather informations"" (perceiving), it makes sense to the other function to be the opposite is ""gives informations"" (judging), and what I mean by giving informations is ""execute informations""

so Si Te for example...

,ESTJ,"Hello, I am a 23 year old INTJ 8w7 and I was looking for an ESTJ to be friends with.

The reason is that I realize that I don’t know or understand ESTJs so I wanted to do so.

I’ll be honest, I’m working to get my life together since I was reckless in the past and was depressed from it. I take my adhd medication now and I know you guys get a lot of posts asking for help, that’s not my purpose here. I simply want to get to know an ESTJ.

I’m at the point in my life where I get something done daily and am becoming more disciplined, focusing on habits and mindset.

So I’ll share about me so you can decide if it interests you:

I meditate and read daily, run atleast 3 times a week for an hour. 

I did Muay Thai for 3 months and stopped cause I’m broke rn but intend on going back when I find a new job.

My main focuses in life are Music, Art, filmmaking, coding. No I’m not making money from these nor have I mastered these yet. 

Music: I like to sing, rap, poetry, play piano, produce music and make my own songs. 

Filmmaking: photography, filmmaking itself, video editing.

Coding: just doing cs50 rn going into a program in September.

Art: drawing, graphic design.

These are the disciplines I’m dedicating my life to, and I need them to combine them.

,ESTJ,"Do you too always end up alone at parties/social events?
Even though I initiate conversations, try my best to be a good listener and come up with topics I believe the other person would find interesting, yadda yadda yadda, I always find myself alone somewhere in a corner either talking to people no one else is talking to or just by myself looking for an opportunity to join someone I find interesting to talk to. Even my friends/people who I came with and who, when talking to them 1-on-1, I believe, enjoy talking to me, go on and find other people to talk to.

My gf told me that I often come over as too serious and too stiff and that this could be the reason, but even at serious/business events people never stay around for longer than a few sentences.
Is it because I just can’t fake laugh or talk non-sense for ever? I can hardly imagine that that’s everything other people are talking about all the time, or is it? Am I just always asking the wrong questions at the wrong time?

Is this a common issue with ESTJs? I am starting to think that it’s my face … I have never had problems with my self-esteem but this is really making me feel less confident/attractive and it’s beginning to take a toll on how I percieve myself.

""Ebenezer Scrooge had a point about decreasing surplus populations.""

""Smalltalk should be punishable by death.""

""Let stupid and lazy people die from their own stupidity and laziness. Social darwinism takes no prisoners.""

""Oh screw turning the other cheek. I say 'if some moron smacks you on one cheek,freaking SMASH his head in with an axe and spit on his corpse'. Self-preservation above all else,Nietzsche had the right idea.""



""There really is nothing more satisfying than a loud attention seeking drama queen getting their mouth duct taped shut for the first time ever.""

""My life motto is one very simple;leave me alone or I will kill you.""

""Few things make my blood boil more than someone asking for help from me;I wanna be left alone in peace to do my own thing in the corner and not be distracted. Next time some lazy gossiper asks me for help for anything,my eyes will roll so hard to the back of my head I will get a thousand migraines at once.""

""I just wish we could live in a world where everyone keeps to themselves and leaves each other alone,why is that so goddamn hard to understand?""

""Life isn't pain,some people just suck at it.""



""I am pure misanthropy in physical form.""

'I have an idea:let's create a new religion that basically says:'smart and capable people go to heaven,dumb and weak people go to hell,every man for himself,don't be a leech.'

,ESTJ,"So my roommate is an ESTJ and I’m an ENFP and in my persceptive our compatibility is so fluctuating. Sometimes we match really well and we get along well, but sometimes I feel like we just don’t understand eachother and get frustrated. Or at least I do. One thing I struggle with with her is that she is a very bad listener (idk if that is n ESTJ thing or just her thing). In conversations with her she talks a lot and tells a lot of not important details or stories from long ago and I try my best to listen, ask questions and understand what she wants to say. But when I respond to her or tell something myself she gets destracted and then responds, or even interrupts, with something completely off topic totally unbothered by what I just said. She does this with other roommates too and we have talked to her about this a few times but it is a recurring theme. 

You could say maybe she just doesnt find us important enough to care but I know that we are in her closer cirlce and I am one of the few people she opens up to and comes to when she wants to vent her heart (maybe also because I ask her the questions she needs to do so). 

But this way of interacting, where there is very little interaction and ask for depth that does not concern her, asks more of my energy than it gives me. I would appreciate it if she would be more bothered with how I am doing or even see here care about how others are doing.

,ESTJ,"Hey

So I'm somewhat familiar with mbti and cognitive functions. Yet I can't pin point a type. I've tested as an Entj, Estj, and an Estp.(also the introverted versions as well)

Anyways I've been told by some people who are aware of mbti that outwardly I come off stpish. I've been compared to mostly stp and stj characters with occasional ntj ones by my wife and close people. I do tend to relate to all 3 of those types. 

The stp mbti description is fitting but cognitive function wise entj seems to fit me. 

Some random info

I like having things decided. 

I want to get things done and not Ponder for hours. I don't like wasting time.

I'm an auditor and actually enjoy it

I'm told I'm assertive, pushy and relentless

,ESTJ,"I’m a ISFP. We are all in grad school. First time ever taking to ESTJ. It’s just super weird. We saw each other in class all the day and just today we have a zoom group meeting together. I walked up to him in the school building and said that I know him from previous classes, he said something like “oh do we I was too focused when I do things so I never noticed you. “ (weird cuz I talk in class as well, most people knows me) I was like oh make sense you ask lots of bold questions in class. And then we had a heated debate on whether his straightforwardness and ignore the political correctness and insist on the logical thing is a good thing to do in California. And then I asked about his MBTI. He asked me what is it and I explained.he made some bad jokes like “oh nice nice hope school don’t kick me out if I get the wrong result”etc. at that moment I wasn’t sure if he’s interested (in the MBTI or in me) or just polite or etc so I said you don’t have to. But he said I pitched his interest. And when I talked to him and explain my emotional sways of viewings things he called it “fascinating and insightful”. It’s just weird cuz later when I asked his age. I guessed 27 but he laughed and told me the students he’s TAing guesses he’s 36. Then I asked his age again. He told me he’s in School while there’s dinosaurs in there. And then when I show curiosity again,he act a bit uncomfortable and say “now I’m feeling comfortable telling you my age now”. So I wrapped up the conversation and later that day he basically avoided eye contact but did open the door when I was behind him.  I know later he literally graduated the same year as I form college which mean we both are 23. What the fuvk just happened. Did I do something wrong?

I walked up to him in the school building and said that I know him from previous classes, he said something like “oh do we I was too focused when I do things so I never noticed you. “ (weird cuz I talk in class as well, most people knows me) I was like oh make sense you ask lots of bold questions in class. And then we had a heated debate on whether his straightforwardness and ignore the political correctness and insist on the logical thing is a good thing to do in California. And then I asked about his MBTI. He asked me what is it and I explained.he made some bad jokes like “oh nice nice hope school don’t kick me out if I get the wrong result”etc. at that moment I wasn’t sure if he’s interested (in the MBTI or in me) or just polite or etc so I said you don’t have to. But he said I pitched his interest. And when I talked to him and explain my emotional sways of viewings things he called it “fascinating and insightful”. It’s just weird cuz later when I asked his age. I guessed 27 but he laughed and told me the students he’s TAing guesses he’s 36. Then I asked his age again. He told me he’s in School while there’s dinosaurs in there. And then when I show curiosity again,he act a bit uncomfortable and say “now I’m feeling comfortable telling you my age now”. So I wrapped up the conversation and later that day he basically avoided eye contact but did open the door when I was behind him.  I know later he literally graduated the same year as I form college which mean we both are 23. What the fuvk just happened. Did I do something wrong? I’m confused because I thought it was just normal conversation and he shared more things than age. So I dunno if age is a thing??? Or does he hate me??? Or like me??? Wtf just happened?&lt;/p&gt;

,ESTJ,"Has anyone else gone from a supervisory or managerial position to a more technical position?

I’ve been with my company for 14 years.

,ESTJ,"ESTJs who have INTPs as friends, (co)workers and partners, what is your dynamic like?

If you don't have an INTP, what do you think about them in general?

My opinion (Marked as spoiler so you can read if you are interested):

&gt;!I know a few ESTJs myself. My mom is also an ESTJ, and to be fair, our dynamic is great, which is very unlike from what you have probably seen throughout many mbti related subreddits.!&lt;

&gt;!Also, ESTJs that I know are actually fun to hangout with and compared to ENTJs are way more laidback. Truth is, I like ESTJs more than ENTJs. While, our Ti and Te may clash from time to time, the Si and Ne clicks pretty well. !&lt;

&gt;!I personally don't like the picture that is painted by those who don't really understand mbti types. To be exact, I don't like the whole ""ESTJs are bossy assholes"" picture. Hanging with a few of them made me see for myself that they're not really as bossy as that they actually want to keep control of the room (figuratively speaking) because your dominant Te and auxiliary Si is used to keeping things under control. Which is where I get similar to ESTJs to a degree. I can follow the rules, as long as they make logical sense to me.!&lt;

&gt;!But most forget that you have Ne tertiary, which can make you pretty chaotic, witty and funny, and are aspired by those who have higher Ne. And many forget that ESTJs (probably not those that spend their time on Reddit 24/7) can develop their Fi and, if well developed, are able to control their harsh personality.

To be exact, I don&amp;#39;t like the whole &amp;quot;ESTJs are bossy assholes&amp;quot; picture. Hanging with a few of them made me see for myself that they&amp;#39;re not really as bossy as that they actually want to keep control of the room (figuratively speaking) because your dominant Te and auxiliary Si is used to keeping things under control. Which is where I get similar to ESTJs to a degree. I can follow the rules, as long as they make logical sense to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;But most forget that you have Ne tertiary, which can make you pretty chaotic, witty and funny, and are aspired by those who have higher Ne. And many forget that ESTJs (probably not those that spend their time on Reddit 24/7) can develop their Fi and, if well developed, are able to control their harsh personality. My mom is an ESTJ by book, but she wouldn&amp;#39;t step over someone (unless she was given a damn good reason to) because for her, that&amp;#39;s a wrong thing to do in her heart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,ESTJ,"I'm a 25yo female ENTP and my dad is an ESTJ. I have quite severe ADHD and so does my ENFP sister. I think my ENFJ sister has it as well. 

My therapist told me ADHD is genetic and asked if one of my parents has it. I dont think my mom does but my dad has mentioned that he thinks he has it before. 

This doesn't make sense to me because he's literally always on top of everything in his life in addition to being on top of everything in our family's life (in a good way). Like he'll still send me reminders to do things because I mentioned it to him a while ago and he knows ill forget. Its one of the ways he shows he cares and we all love that about him and make sure he knows we appreciate him for it. Hes always organized, always does things IMMEDIATELY if they need to be done. He doesn't even wait a second to procrastinate anything. 

The only thing I can think of would be his tendency to lose control of his temper/emotions when he gets overwhelmed and feels like we arent listening to him or understanding or respecting him. Hell blow up and get overly emotional then feel bad afterward. I also have this tendency and know this can be common in individuals with ADHD. Maybe as an ESTJ, ADHD just manifests differently.

I know our types arent known to really get along or appreciate each other but I will always have a special place in my heart for you guys because I couldn't have asked for a better dad and being raised by an ESTJ has helped me recognize and develop my weaknesses as an ENTP.

# Hi ESTJs, I am an INFJ

I have been going thru a messy week and I am so stressed out about what is the reality now,

I had a group discussion with an INFP, an ESTJ and another un-typed person. We planed to film a video during the meeting but I misunderstood and was not mentally, physically and spiritually prepared for it. Before the meeting was a very long week and I had to travel 2 hours to get to meet them. Therefore I was stressed and appeared to be very disturbed. We argued and I admit I was wrong and I did pretty act up but I did not yell nor swear nor do anything (I think was) disrespectful.

The discussion was basically about them wanting to make 1 video at a time while I wanted to write the scripts of 10 videos and film all at once. I didn't feel heard at all cuz they had not known my ideas nor planned things out with me first but rather wanted me to do it right away. Eventually, they agreed to let me present my ideas.

When I was showing my ideas the INFP interrupted me by asking an irrelevant question (""How much GB is this laptop?"") so I got impatient and let them finish then asked them ""You done?""

They approved the ideas and I was required to produce a script immediately. I turned to ask the ESTJ to help me out with it cuz they was in charge of the content too. However,..

The ESTJ then said that I was vile, called me a child, a b\*tch and a b\*lly. He said I was being condescending in my tone of voice and that I ""vomit my emotions out"" without caring about others' emotions.

I ended up filming a video as they requested and asked the ESTJ if I could have used Teleprompter. He did not approve then I said ""I'm sorry but can we just try.."" He did not let me finish the sentence but told me that I did not listened to anyone and only did what I want. I was trying to be open to the possibilities and I do respect his opinion

We then had a discussion about what had happened but the ESTJ was still very aggressive and said he did not remember me saying ""I'm sorry but can we just try.."". I said sorry I made them feel that way and he said he did not forgive me but gave me a second chance.

The untyped person then said that I was being competitive and they assumed I was afraid of being not as good as the ESTJ when I told the ESTJ ""You are working too much."" What I really meant by that was because I felt sad he had to work too much for the team. It's all out of my compassion.

\_\_\_

What I feel after this is that it was my fault but what I am thinking is that was I really the bully and did I really make them feel bullied.

I feel so sad because my compassion for people is read wrong. In the meantime I truly don't want to cause people the feeling of being bullied.

,ESTJ,"I am not necessarily looking for a correlation to gender and femininity. Just curious to hear from other female ESTJ's.

As a kid I was always called a tomboy, playing videogames and playing soccer with the boys. In high school I was never occupied with make-up, latest trends, clothes or boys. In college I started being more feminine I guess, using make up and enjoy cute clothes. Now I am 28 and I am caring less about that stuff again. People have always told me I have very strong masculine energy. I feel like it's partly from my practical mindset. I see no point buying/putting on expensive make up just to go to work or to buy groceries. I only use make up on special occasions. I only know the very basics of make up, meaning I don't even know how to use eyeliner. I wear dresses more in spring/summer because  they're easy to wear and take off and it's just pretty (I like colorful clothes usually). I have never had my nails done nor gotten a beauty treatment or whatever.

The only time I notice I become a lot more girly is when I am talking to or dating a guy who has stronger masculine energy than me. Only happened once or twice in my life. And both times the guys were very surprised when I was e.g. putting on make up and wearing very girly clothes saying they never thought I could be that way. It was a nice surprise for them though.

I just feel like only people with a stronger, confident and more dominant energy can bring out this side in me. It also helps me figure out if the guy I am seeing is compatible or not with me since guys with a weaker masculine energy than me always end up annoying the fuck out of me and make me lose interest. I think in a way I just want to feel safe and taken care of with a romantic partner and that won't happen if I am the dominant one in my personal experience. Guys who had weaker energy than me always complained to me how I emasculated them and that I was too domineering and I should ""let"" them take the lead more which just makes me cringe.

Hallo cool and productive ESTJs! (and eventual other types)

Im doing some hobbiest research for a upcomming book based on LOTS of crossreffered interviews from EACH MBTI type about relationships related behaviours.

I have a standardized questioneer that one will have to answer in a honest way in a PM    setting. There are no wrong answers unless of cause they are dishonest.

I want it to happen in a private chat, since i prioitize a safe space for my questioneers to do the qustions in as high quality as possible. The questions will be about vulnerability, good and bad habbits, or if there has been any faul play inside a past relationship.

I allready have about 50 pages of more than 50 collected interviews but I will need a lot more, if one answers all the questions, one can eventually get my book when I eventually get done with it for free, or ask anything about ISTPs wich is a topic certainly within my expertise.

Im looking forward to collaberate with ye all, thank you for reading and considering helping me out!

**Deductive reasoning:**  

**1.** The ability to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense.   

**2.** An example of a deduction is Aristotelian syllogisms: *“All men are mortal. Plato is a man. Therefore, Plato is mortal.”*  

**3.** The reasoning flows in the direction of *simple to complex*. It mentally complicate the situation.  

**Inductive reasoning:**  

**1.** “The ability to combine pieces of information to form general rules or conclusions (*includes finding a relationship among seemingly unrelated events*).”  

**2.** Observing and comprehending complex phenomena, inductive thinking reduces them to generalized diagrams and models stripped of details. 

**3.** Inductive thinkers break down and simplify the situation in order to understand it. Reasoning flows in reverse order from *complex to simple*.

She's in her 50s and often talks about growing up and being ""like me"": In her room or to herself, and just doing whatever her parents threw her into. However, whenever her dad was being abusive to her, she'd ignore him for the day and it would work, even if his screams were deafening. If he was being abusive to her siblings, though, or if anyone else was in trouble, she'd call out the attacker's bullcrap, but with the mild temperament she had at the time.

Now life and trauma has significantly toughened her up, and she wishes to be less emotional when confronting issues she's really passionate about (she has quite a lot!), but it doesn't seem like neither of us really understand how she became who she is now.

If he was being abusive to her siblings, though, or if anyone else was in trouble, she&amp;#39;d call out the attacker&amp;#39;s bullcrap, but with the mild temperament she had at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now life and trauma has significantly toughened her up, and she wishes to be less emotional when confronting issues she&amp;#39;s really passionate about (she has quite a lot!), but it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like neither of us really understand how she became who she is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you guys kinda relate to this? How shy or mild were you when you were younger? If significantly so, what changed?&lt;/p&gt;

Few years back, I had INFP male as my boss and I am ESTJ female. I wasn't knew MBTI then and I'm sure he didn't knew either. He was unhealthy INFP as he was holding job position which was  not suitable for his personality. He was lead and supposed to be responsible for delivery and team management. He was unable to do so because he used to think a lot about future, he used to hate process and mended bended that numerous times. He used to be tactless while talking to people and even arrogant at times. He used to hate mundane tasks. He was extreme introvert. As result, he was quite unpopular and he was not giving damn to it anyway

On my part, looking at his behaviour, I assumed he has attitude issue. I stayed away from him, never opened up with him as i was seeing red flags in his behaviour. I am talking about pure work relationship, no romance involved. We worked together as parallel lines for couple of years. We never fought but never really impressed by each other either. However, projects we worked were success, may be because we were balancing it with our personalities unknowingly 

He always focused on multiple solutions etc where I used to be impatient if I don't complete day to day tasks. His expectations of me changed later, he kept on saying like give this mundane tasks to other juniors and make yourself free for next level but honestly, I never understood what he wanted to say then. I was immature ESTJ. 

Then came constant complaints about my work, which I was delivering perfectly fine. In short, he wanted me to use my Ne and Fi which was undeveloped then and he didn't knew it. We had this cold war for few months and situation degraded. Neither of us understood what is happening and we did  not do anything to resolve it

One day, he shouted on me on call. I felt so bad and hurt. I was tired of constant complaints about how I dont see all possible options for issue and use default solution etc. Next day, he may be realized that I did not like it and conveyed his apologies through other person. He mentioned he wants to talk through. I gave up by then mentally and got another job too, so I did not discussed it any further and simply changed job

Later sometime, after like year, I got to know MBTI and I was literally shocked to see that whatever he was saying was true. About Ne and Fi. I could understand he was INFP. It was like mystery resolved for me. Even if II didn't like his complaints about me, in a way  he is reason that I could improve myself for better. 

Since then, I had this eagerness to tell him all this, this might be funny.. this eager. I want to tell him badly that he is INFP. That will give him some peace for sure. He seems to be struggling with world and his role in general. But we are not in contact anymore and there is no way I will connect with him again.

I identify with everything of estj, except the empathetic/emotional component.

It usually doesnt matter if I think their emotions or outbursts are unnecessary/weird. 

Example 1: Handeling and comforting that one friend when she is dumping her frustration about XY 

Example 2: I work in the psychiatric field and have an easy time talking to emotional patients, but also handling aggressive/criminal patients

Some of you may remember that I posted a google forms link on this Subreddit, or if you're seeing this cross-posted from another Subreddit or on PDB, on a community there, for a survey about people's MBTI and Enneagram types. Well, I'm happy to say that the results are in with more than 1,000 responses. Here, I will rank the responses for each Enneagram type by MBTI type. Please remember that this is self-reported, and many of the respondents may be mistyped. And because this is only a small sample of the population, the law of large numbers says not to take this too seriously. Not to mention, the data points are rounded to the nearest tenth. This is entirely for fun and is to be taken with a grain of salt. Some of the results surprised me like the amount of ISTJ 9w1s, but I'm actually happy this surprised me, even though the results are iffy at best because so much is possible between the two systems. I will likely make another post soon with the results for each Enneagram type without wings in total and each MBTI type, but that is to be done at a later date.

Some of you may remember that I posted a google forms link on this Subreddit, or if you&amp;#39;re seeing this cross-posted from another Subreddit or on PDB, on a community there, for a survey about people&amp;#39;s MBTI and Enneagram types. Well, I&amp;#39;m happy to say that the results are in with more than 1,000 responses. Here, I will rank the responses for each Enneagram type by MBTI type. Please remember that this is self-reported, and many of the respondents may be mistyped. And because this is only a small sample of the population, the law of large numbers says not to take this too seriously. Not to mention, the data points are rounded to the nearest tenth. This is entirely for fun and is to be taken with a grain of salt. Some of the results surprised me like the amount of ISTJ 9w1s, but I&amp;#39;m actually happy this surprised me, even though the results are iffy at best because so much is possible between the two systems. I will likely make another post soon with the results for each Enneagram type without wings in total and each MBTI type, but that is to be done at a later date.

,ESTJ,"It seems to me that TJ type men might have difficulty with their 'care' response towards women. I would call this a 'protector' response

It seems like this type tends to freeze up or there is some issue with the fight or flight response. I am bringing this to the ES type subreddit because I believe intuitive-lean would create noise for this question and I trust E types are more likely to have a polished social response since they are more likely to interact with more people.

I am not hating on any type, simply trying to figure out if this is a TJ disconnect. If it is, how it might be solved, or even giving ideas through the examples

The examples I have for you to analyze

1. The man might not hug the woman when she is crying
2. The man doesn't believe the woman when she is in pain (even emergency-level pain)
3. The man doesn't show 'recognition' of an emergency, such as emoting surprise, He is perhaps slow to take action. For example: a paramedic is behind him and he doesn't move out of the way/react quickly, making him a liability in that moment
4. The man does not react to her requests to demonstrate protection: such as 'practice' emergencies or situations the woman fabricates to test his response ability. He doesn't understand that he needs to 'act out' his response and 'pretend' it is real. For example: She is worried about a suicidal friend and texts the man for advice, noting 'it is life or death' even though she knows the friend cries wolf a lot, it is still important to her that the man shows his response abilities. Again, there is a freeze-up or no response from the XXTJ man because perhaps he believes 'I am not there so I cannot stop the person from killing themselves fast enough for my response to matter at this moment' and so the man disregards himself as USELESS in the situation and by doing so actually PROVES hisself to be useless

So these are the only situations I can come up with so far but I have to say they are very off-putting, despite TJ types being known for making very good rational judgements...I can't help but feel responding to the emotional side in a timely and appropriate manner is also a part of being 'rational'?",t2_93agbhcr,False,,0,False,How can women help XXTJ type men with their 'care' response?,[],r/ESTJ,False,,,0,,False,t3_10x6atk,False,light,0.8,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question/Advice,False,3,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1675879718.0,text,,,,text,self.ESTJ,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that TJ type men might have difficulty with their &amp;#39;care&amp;#39; response towards women.

,ESTJ,"I enjoy working my boss. She is 20 years older and mentors me really well. But, I have a hard time managing her emotions of anger when she is frustrated at me for not being able to... think like her. I think my inferior Te has done a good job so far but with the ""mistakes"" I'm making, it seems that I just can't match up with the Te dom. 

I also feel overwhelmed when she corrects me in an angry tone. Whenever I try to clarify with her on the next step seems like I do not know my job well enough, or it makes her stressed as it means she isn't clear enough at giving instructions. And whenever I attempt to complete a task for the first time, I didn't meet her expectations of me as I was not thorough enough, which was expected of me as I have been observing how she manages the work processes (not the exact ones, yes I need to see the pattern). I feel trapped because I couldn't clarify neither am I allowed to make mistakes, its starting to feel a little like a straitjacket. I know I should have a better work ethic, I do want to improve.. 

Also knowing the political ground in the workplace makes me mentally overwhelmed, as there are people that my boss warns me about. 

Its difficult to come up with ideas and solutions while still feeling so overwhelmed with my boss' tendencies and the lack of social harmony in the workplace.

She is 20 years older and mentors me really well. But, I have a hard time managing her emotions of anger when she is frustrated at me for not being able to... think like her. I think my inferior Te has done a good job so far but with the &amp;quot;mistakes&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m making, it seems that I just can&amp;#39;t match up with the Te dom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also feel overwhelmed when she corrects me in an angry tone. Whenever I try to clarify with her on the next step seems like I do not know my job well enough, or it makes her stressed as it means she isn&amp;#39;t clear enough at giving instructions. And whenever I attempt to complete a task for the first time, I didn&amp;#39;t meet her expectations of me as I was not thorough enough, which was expected of me as I have been observing how she manages the work processes (not the exact ones, yes I need to see the pattern). I feel trapped because I couldn&amp;#39;t clarify neither am I allowed to make mistakes, its starting to feel a little like a straitjacket. I know I should have a better work ethic, I do want to improve.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also knowing the political ground in the workplace makes me mentally overwhelmed, as there are people that my boss warns me about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its difficult to come up with ideas and solutions while still feeling so overwhelmed with my boss&amp;#39; tendencies and the lack of social harmony in the workplace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I understand her better? Or be a better employee without getting stunned by her fiery spirit? Its hard for me to think when I just get headaches, as my emotions are on an overwhelm. How do I filter between my emotions and follow what needs to be done, effectively? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll go first. My plans have always been rather simple. I just want to have a lifelong partner, a soulmate. Preferably married. Own a cute little house with a few pets. Advance my social work career where I can work at a university or college with international students and exchange programs. Well, that or working part time at whatever job if my hubby would provide enough. I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind doing more housework to make up for that. I&amp;#39;ve never cared that much about my career path really. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children are something I&amp;#39;m not fixed on, I&amp;#39;d be happy with and without them. I&amp;#39;d also want to live comfortably enough to afford some luxuries I like such as travelling and tattoos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how about you guys?&lt;/p&gt;

,ESTJ,"I'm outgoing, friendly, and cheerful. I'm talkative and open. I get close to people easily and enjoy making friends. I've had friends in the past say I can be needy or not give them enough space, but it's because I love chatting with friends. At times, I'm not good at reading social cues. I vent a lot and ask for advice. I'm open about being angry or nervous. I don't talk as much about crying, but I still have cried on the phone with friends before. I can be generous by treating friends to fine dining (P.S. I love eating). I love gossiping about people and can be very sassy. I admit I can be judgmental about others, but I'm still really nice. I can get nosy about certain things with friends. Not about their whole life, but certain aspects of it.

I'm really hardworking. I'm like a workaholic with ambitions to be a top position at a top workplace. I'm a planner, efficient, competitive, and use a calendar. I plan things in advance and I'm always early. I make connections at work and take on a lot of tasks, so I'm a top performer. I write detailed notes down for every task in case I need to reference how to do something. With school, I also plan far in advance. I already made an organized list of every class I plan to take up until I graduate.

I have an assertive, leader personality. I take action for what I want and I'm not afraid to make a move on a guy first. Well, it can be a bit nerve-wracking. I still gain the courage to do it though. I can have trouble taking no for an answer because I really want what I want. I move quickly, but I can be fickle about who I like or what I want out of a relationship. Since I feel I'm a Type A woman, I'd also want a guy similar. I like confident, assertive, smart, nice, and cool men who are successful. I feel I come off intimidating to some of them. People say I give off business vibes and I grew up in wealth, so I'd like to find someone similar. I have high libido, so I like casual relationships too.

Some flaws I can work on are being insensitive, stubborn, temperamental, arrogant, confrontational, argumentative, passive-aggressive, and aggressive. I have confronted many classmates in the past and have been a snitch on several occasions. I get angry easily and thinking back on things that made me angry can just piss me off again. I like to roast others, but I can get defensive if I get roasted. During arguments, old friends have said I always think I'm right and refuse to see others' point of views. I can be impatient and inflexible. Often, I do want things to go my way, so I could work on this. I can also be sort of blunt or show off my wealth a bit too much at times. I'm a huge spender and I love the finer things in life along with the finer lifestyle. My friends have told me I have trouble admitting things that could hurt my ego. I'm not aware of it, but I guess that makes me prideful.

,ESTJ,"Hi all, 

I was wondering how you (estj) view/experience INTJ's (especially in the workplace)?

Context: 

*   Region: Scale-up environment in EU.
*   Manager - Employee Relationship

As an INTJ, I now experience for the 2° time in a row an ESTJ as my manager. I am working for a longer time at the company than them. But for the 2° time I don't have a good connection with them.. (Both times they have +-10y more work experience: ESTJ = 40y +) 

1. I wonder if this is just something in general between our types? :) 
2. I admire their dedication (work), planning/organising off teams/projects/targets skills.(manager skills).
3. But I can't seem to connect on the bouncing of ideas of strategy and the bigger picture, the disconnect of ESTJ focussing on details/get it done mindset vs INTJ want to focus/challenge the strategy of the way forward is just annoying as I don't think they really 'get' me or respect my ideas, I do see that they have their way/strategy..but are less open for discussion/challenge.. This all leads to me questioning their leadership skills and even thinking of switching employer as I don't want to be in the same position for the next 2y.. 
4. I am not sure how an ESTJ would respond to this honest feedback, and if it would just spiral back in a negative way for me..

,ESTJ,"Hey everyone! INFJ here. Hope you're all doing well.

I know ESTJs are a broad range of people so answers will differ, but I just thought I'd ask the general question and see what comes back.

E.g., there is unresolved conflict/tension in your family, and your family member proposes you and another family member try some family therapy.

- If your answer is yes, why?
- If no, also why? And what would help instead/what would you prefer? What kind of sell would get you to say yes?

I'm trying very hard to not be vague for you guys, so some context for you:

- Family dynamic: Boomer ISFJ mother, 30ish ESTJ elder daughter, late 20's INFJ younger daughter (it's a me)
- ISFJ mum and ESTJ sis have been at odds with each other since I can remember, but they always made up in the past.
- Their relationship has continued to get worse and worse, to quite bad, in the past 5 or so years. 

- Key communication issues are: 

- ESTJ sis very bad at reading feelings, intentions, emotional situations/environments and uses her internal logic based on incomplete/inaccurate data to make incorrect and often harsh judgements. When told these judgements don't include the full picture and miss the mark, refuses to budge/always needs to be right.

- ISFJ mum feels threatened when ESTJ questions her. ESTJ is trying to parse ISFJ's feelings and decisions through ESTJ's internal logic systems, which makes the ISFJ feel she's being disrespected and interrogated. ISFJ Shuts down as she doesn't feel psychologically safe. Escalates situations instead of de-escalating them, and when triggered can come across as (I hate to use this word but) neurotic, and passive aggressive.

I dont have the emotional energy to deal with it, but my hope is that if they went to family therapy:
- ESTJ would be more willing to listen to the advice of a third party with some authority who could guide her through putting herself in the shoes of others 
- ISFJ would feel that by having a third party there, they could guide her through verbalising her feelings and explaining her behaviours, so she could find more helpful tools to handle conflict and overwhelm.

May not be particular to type but just my family members, but I'm assuming their reactions would be:
- ESTJ: The ISFJ is wrong so why do we need to bother. There's nothing wrong with me and mum is just irrational. Might get some insights from therapy and then forget about it after a month or so.
- ISFJ: More willing to attend but unlikely she'd fully put her trust in the process, be resistant to opening up to a therapist, or actually putting into practice what they tell her to do outside of the therapist's office.

This is all probably TMI but I lurk here sometimes and assume you guys like to know why a question is being asked :)

,ESTJ,"Hey, good folks. I hope I'm not too annoying with my N or N-like way of being. I would hate to pressure anybody into reading a textwall, so please feel free to stop reading after the picture below, which is probably the most important part. The TL;DR is already contained in the title. Absolutely feel free to stop reading and ignore this if it gets too tedious while reading.

So, today, I took the Mistype Investigator's test and here's what I got:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2c8j5e9wcv5a1.png?width=1565&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=228112481b2b90658858a856c5efdf1a7018e115

A look at these is sufficient to tell why typing me is going to be a difficult task if not a fool's errand.

Out of these, TiNe or NeTi (as dom and aux) tends to be my consistent result, although in some tests under some theories Fi rears its head and flips me to F (e.g. Satinorva gave me INTP under a letter-based approach and INFP under its function-based approach). Fe being the lowest or second-lowest of them all also is a consistent trend. I get a huge variance in Te from one test to the text. Here, from Mistype Investigator, it was the highest and likely dom, while from Satinorva it got the lowest of all partial scores. In Michael Kaloz's test, I had a large Te, about 2/3 through, like here, but with a maxed-out Ti. Another consistent trend is for my Si and Se to place lowest and equal to each other.

When it comes to the type I get, as opposed to the raws, it's usually ENTP but very often INTP. In my early twenties (effectively extended teens, as I was more of an old adolescent than a young adult), I usually tested INTJ, though variance was high. In my early thirties I kept getting ENTP but fence-sitting on the E and the P in the letter-based approach, disregarding the functions. A month or so ago (closing in on my 40th birthday) I begin to get INTP from functions-based tests, with one INFP result.…

… And now this ESTP categorization despite my Ne being bigger — for lack of a better word due to me being a n00b — than my Si and Se, but my Si seems to be bigger than my Ni. Obviously, the differences among Fi, Ni and Se seem to be clearly within the margin of error, including the limits of hand-eye co-ordination when pushing the sliders (no steps, fluid scale), and even the Si is just &lt;2pp higher, so not the height of reliability.

For context, this seems to be consistent with my repeatedly balanced results in any kind of four-temperaments tests I take. I may be a balanced or undecided personality; adult ADHD may be a problem, as well as constantly living under a great deal of stress, so never in optimal conditions. Almost every type feels like a side of my personality when I read the descriptions, although not all in the same degree. Reading typical ENTP and INTP descriptions in particular feels like they describe two co-equal sides of me (like left lung and right lung), whereas some of the F or S types feels like something I might have developed into if I had been allowed to develop normally as a child, and like modes I can switch into. I can switch into INFP mode (negotiator/mediator), ENFJ mode (typical non-caster protagonist in RPG games), ESTP (smooth operator), ESTJ (executive), ENTJ (marshal on campaign), INTJ (mastermind planner), but it only feels like a 'mode'.

In Enneagram, I get a lot of variance, but high raw results in One, Eight and Nine tend to be common. I sometimes place 4w5 or 5w4 but often 1, 8 or 9w1. I'm obviously aware that a healthy Four will act like a healthy One and that a One may self-mistype as an Eight for the confidence boost.

My Gallup looks like this, and it seems to be consistent with NT:

However, I used to have great memory, such as remembering the regnal years for most of European monarchs, not needing a phone book, knowing the docket numbers of my cases and dates of hearings and rulings in them by heart, committing 9-digit phone numbers to memory without having to note them down (now I struggle with 6 digits), names, faces, recipes and more, although I'd never had photographic memory. I was also a conservative and a sort of upholder of traditional and community values, before the world around me transformed and moved away from those values. I can recognize inconsistencies and change. I like to be surrounded by data and munch on it. Although I like the intuitive stuff, I also like to learn how a device works by simply operating it, perhaps even stripping it apart to see how it works but not really, as I'm not technical, though I used to show a tendency in that direction. Another example is coffee machines — I'm drawn to the manually operated ones where you control the pressure, timing and everything else based on how it goes, muscle memory and muscle feedback, as opposed to playing with all the buttons and LED displays, automated settings, etc. Although I have a distaste of fixed procedures, that is generally due to the intellectual limitations in their design, not covering whatever they should cover, people trying to apply them too literally to 'hard cases' (which make for bad laws), so I prefer not to be bound by procedures or guidelines written by someone else if the job is to be done right on my watch and under my responsibility. I can be set in my ways, such as struggling to respond in real time to feedback received in real time, e.g. modify my behaviour if e.g. I spill water when watering a plant or pouring into a glass, I will often catch myself trying to brute-force it and of course failing, because how else, I should have known better. I'm also big on verifying traditions that don't check out (e.g. lower-order moral rules that are almost universally accepted by society but seem to be inconsistent with the higher-order moral rules professed by the same society; anything else that isn't fit for its intended purpose or doesn't comply with its professed values or otherwise fails the consistency/suitability test).

My professional life is generally a better indicator of anything close to natural or healthy than my private life, and it shows different tendencies. From Gallup's little business brother, the Builder BP10 test mostly intended for founders of startups (which I technically am but only because my freelance professional practice is technically a sole-prop, akin to a 100% owned small company), I got 1. Disruptor, 2. Knowledge, 3. Selling (charisma), 4. Independence, with a role classification of 'Expert' (rather than typical executive) and with the added proviso that my working style seems to emphasize a network of informal relationships with people. This all checks out remarkably, and I almost completely agree. I swim against the tide, despite being a conservative/traditional, I can't escape being knowledge-based (can't escape the 'sage/magician' archetype and couldn't possibly be a pure 'king' or 'warrior', forget 'lover'), I have strong charisma and selling skills, which I usually prefer not to use and have a complicated relationship with, and I usually operate independently (lone-wolf style) despite being collectively- and community-minded and loving the family, community and team vibes and always wanting to have multiple perspectives (considering them myself and sourcing them from others). And my way of dealing with 'matters' could resemble an ESTP at work (think Commissioner Selwyn Patterson hard at work). Informal, outside of formal procedures and official tracks, based on connections, stopping barely short of drawing an unfair advantage and committing an ethical violation in the dealing. Contracts settled on a handshake, oral agreements involving significant amounts of money, conversations off the record and without an e-mail trail, there is quite a lot of that.

I can grasp complex legal concepts and explain them simply. I can create my own too. I can reconstruct systems easily, distill rules from precedents, spot inconsistencies, but I'm neither as perceptive with regard to every little detail as a normal S person would be, nor the kind of abstract philosopher/scientist as one would expect an N person to be. I can handle philosophy when it comes my way, though I wouldn't normally chase it on my own initiative, let alone sit on my ass contemplating the meaning of the universe or the ideal form of government… unless I had a reason to; then I could plough through it like any other 10 people. But I'd rather be reading a historical novel or playing a role-playing game normally. I get along with philosophers and theorists, though I'm not one of them (except perhaps a theorist in my narrow Ph.D. field and a couple of other narrow fields, such as the teachings of my religion), and among normal people I'm too much of a philosopher and theorist. I suppose I'm too N for normal people (even pragmatic but not practical, by the normal person's standards; too detached, erratic, ditzy, not paying attention to mundane things, etc., though strangely aware of the surroundings) but too S for true, real Ns. This is similar to how I am too T for normal people but too F for hardcore intellectuals, hard scientists, forensics, etc.

I don't have the whole 'body' thing, my co-ordination is certified impaired (born two months preterm nad later 'cured' of left-handedness at the beginning of school education more than 30 years ago), I don't have balance (can't bike or skate), but I can be hypersensitive to sound or to the touch of rough materials on my (allergic) skin, and I appreciate the taste of good coffee, I like to cook, I'm super excited by photos of nature, and I like to watch travel docs, but it's like 'wow! this feels so good! I could do it all day!', except I actually end up doing it very rarely, similarly to how I enjoy 'Ultra HD' music and have invested a bit in the equipmen but end up listening to it only rarely for some reason. I've recently developed an obsession with maximizing the detail level in my computer games — ultra settings, even at the cost of low fps, just not to miss out on the eye candy. It's all erratic and just frankly messed up, much like my biography and whatever passes for my personality development. Again, in Enneagram, I sometimes get Four, i.e. the type of person who's searching for his own identity, and I can obviously see why, in more than one way, not that I meditate daily on it when I'm not in a rut.

I suppose in an ideal world and with most of my problems out of way, I could live the happy life a manager somewhere or owner-and-manager of some sort of small business or leader in an organization. The life of a generalist manager not too high up the chain, with the typical occupations and responsibilities of the position feels like an Utopia of peaceful life to me (inner peace, not like expecting there would be no conflict, of course). But perhaps circumstances have pushed me down the NT road, the lonely life of a freelance/expert that's consistent with some tendencies in my personality but perhaps not the life I desire or not the life I would be living in the ideal conditions. This is difficult to judge.

So… could someone with experience in this, e.g. someone who — in additon to oneself being a real ESTJ and knowing what that feels like, thinks like, acts like, speaks like, etc. — knows a lot about MBTI and/or someone who is an S long mistyped as an N, give me some pointers as to how to determine whether I'm N or S or sitting on the fence between the two?",t2_66ufdrvc,False,,0,False,So… I got an ESTJ result from Mistype Investigator after a lifetime of almost always testing as an N.

The TL;DR is already contained in the title. Absolutely feel free to stop reading and ignore this if it gets too tedious while reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, today, I took the Mistype Investigator&amp;#39;s test and here&amp;#39;s what I got:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/2c8j5e9wcv5a1.png?width=1565&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=228112481b2b90658858a856c5efdf1a7018e115""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/2c8j5e9wcv5a1.png?width=1565&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=228112481b2b90658858a856c5efdf1a7018e115&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A look at these is sufficient to tell why typing me is going to be a difficult task if not a fool&amp;#39;s errand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of these, TiNe or NeTi (as dom and aux) tends to be my consistent result, although in some tests under some theories Fi rears its head and flips me to F (e.g. Satinorva gave me INTP under a letter-based approach and INFP under its function-based approach). Fe being the lowest or second-lowest of them all also is a consistent trend. I get a huge variance in Te from one test to the text. Here, from Mistype Investigator, it was the highest and likely dom, while from Satinorva it got the lowest of all partial scores. In Michael Kaloz&amp;#39;s test, I had a large Te, about 2/3 through, like here, but with a maxed-out Ti. Another consistent trend is for my Si and Se to place lowest and equal to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the type I get, as opposed to the raws, it&amp;#39;s usually ENTP but very often INTP.

A month or so ago (closing in on my 40th birthday) I begin to get INTP from functions-based tests, with one INFP result.…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… And now this ESTP categorization despite my Ne being bigger — for lack of a better word due to me being a n00b — than my Si and Se, but my Si seems to be bigger than my Ni. Obviously, the differences among Fi, Ni and Se seem to be clearly within the margin of error, including the limits of hand-eye co-ordination when pushing the sliders (no steps, fluid scale), and even the Si is just &amp;lt;2pp higher, so not the height of reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context, this seems to be consistent with my repeatedly balanced results in any kind of four-temperaments tests I take.

&lt;p&gt;In Enneagram, I get a lot of variance, but high raw results in One, Eight and Nine tend to be common. I sometimes place 4w5 or 5w4 but often 1, 8 or 9w1. I&amp;#39;m obviously aware that a healthy Four will act like a healthy One and that a One may self-mistype as an Eight for the confidence boost.&lt;/p&gt;

,ESTJ," Hi, I'm writing a series analysing film characters who align with MBTI types. This post looks at the 2022 film ""Everything Everywhere all at Once"" starring Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn (ESTJ) and Ke Huy Quan as Waymond (INFP). It's a bit long but I hope this resonates with people, especially the ESTJs and INFPs out there.

Introduction

To re-describe the film in terms of the cognitive functions, Evelyn starts off with very poor usage of her Ter Ne and Inf Fi, and an inability to appreciate the Fi strengths of her INFP husband Waymond. Throughout the film, she learns to channel her comfort zone of Tertiary Extroverted Intuition (Ter Ne) in a healthier way, and she even plunges the depths into the darkest corner of her psyche (ESTJ sub-Ter Ni). With the knowledge and wisdom she has gained from exploring the other versions of herself across the multiverse, she learns to develop her Inf Fi and to appreciate her husband’s strengths, eventually using her weakness (Inf Fi) to save her relationships with her daughter and her husband.

Part 1: A Portrait of the Unhealthy ESTJ

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXT75VBulRI&amp;t=52s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXT75VBulRI&amp;t=52s)

The first thing we notice about Evelyn is her constant rush and hurry to get things done; there is a helter-skelter nature in her demeanour, overwhelmed with ever-lengthening lists of things ‘to do’, and each task must be done correctly. This is a manifestation of Evelyn’s Dominant Extroverted Thinking (Dom Te) and Tertiary Extroverted Intuition (Ter Ne) as an ESTJ.

[Extroverted Thinking (Te) is the objective judgement of quantifiable things](https://medium.com/@TypologyThoughts/the-cognitive-functions-part-1-of-2-defining-the-eight-building-blocks-of-the-human-psyche-d5efdcfb2188), meaning it focuses on completing measurable tasks efficiently. [Extroverted Intuition (Ne) is the objective perception of implications and possibilities.](https://medium.com/@TypologyThoughts/the-cognitive-functions-part-1-of-2-defining-the-eight-building-blocks-of-the-human-psyche-d5efdcfb2188) I’ve described it previously as a ‘squirrel spirit’, always darting to different items of interest. In an ENFP (Dom Ne, Aux Fi) or ESFJ (Dom Fe, Ter Ne), their powerful Ne is channeled towards unquantifiable, quirky and eclectic ideas and tastes due to the influence of Aux Fi and Dom Fe respectively. In Evelyn as an ESTJ however, this squirrel spirit is darting towards different tasks and responsibilities around her; from cooking enough noodles to painting wet spots to destroying googly eyes.

Evelyn’s concentration on the work of party preparations contrasts with Waymond who is much more interested in having a heartfelt conversation. Evelyn constantly ignores Waymond’s questions, treating them as irrelevant distractions. And yet Waymond (INFP Dom Fi) takes no offence and patiently focuses his efforts to make Evelyn feel valued. We will get more into Waymond’s perspective in Part 3.

When Evelyn sees Becky at 3:30, she makes no effort to express welcome, only frustration at the complications it brings to her party preparation efforts. The presence of Becky is understood by Evelyn as simply an additional mouth to feed for dinner, rather than the social and personal implication of her daughter bringing her partner to meet the parents. For Evelyn as a Dom Te, the situations she views through her Te lens are reduced into quantifiable tasks, with little concern for how Becky would react to being treated so coldly, or how Joy would be disappointed at her attempt to introduced her beloved to her parents. In the end at 3:53 it is Waymond who cheerfully welcomes Becky.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1wDm0w9uSQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1wDm0w9uSQ)

Evelyn is frustrated at Waymond for his “distracting” and playful nature. At the core of her frustration; she as a Dom Te sees the world through the lens of Te, and she sees Waymond’s Inf Te like a businessman looking at a child. She doesn’t recognise the ways in which Waymond (INFP Dom Fi) is far more mature than her (ESTJ Inf Fi) in matters of the heart. Hence, she infantalises him. She only sees through one lens (Te), and through that lens, she is the mature adult and Waymond is the immature child incapable of survival. She is not aware of the other lenses in which she is the child.

[The Dominant function is powerful, but because it is so ingrained in our psyche, it is almost unnoticeable, like how a fish would never notice water. ](https://medium.com/@TypologyThoughts/function-slots-and-their-characteristics-fc31e3b0fd2)We see that Evelyn suffers from this lack of awareness of her Dominant function. And as part of her journey of self-development, she would need to learn to see through other “lenses” to appreciate the strengths of others, see the weaknesses in herself, and improve on those weaknesses.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgIEcJaQo4E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgIEcJaQo4E)

This scene was quite painful to watch. We see how Evelyn’s ESTJ Inferior/Primitive Introverted Feeling (Inf Fi) utterly fails at connecting with her daughter. Evelyn’s Inf Fi is like a bull in a China shop, unwieldy and blunt, hurting instead of healing.

In the conversation with grandpa, Evelyn does the “practical” thing of brushing off Becky as a simple friend, even when it hurts Joy. And to compound the hurt, Evelyn then runs off as if there was some emergency or something important, only to merely beg an uninterested customer to come to their party. And for the icing on the cake, Evelyn senses that she needs to connect with her daughter but when the moment arrives, all she can mutter is blunt and hurtful words. You can see the regret on Evelyn’s face as Joy drives away.

These are perfect examples of how Evelyn’s ESTJ Inf Fi leads to a poor judgement of unquantifiable matters (feelings, values, interpersonal relationships). She becomes decisive in all the wrong ways, making terrible decisions when it comes to maintaining a happy relationship with her daughter. She keeps prioritising her laundromat and the rules of her household without understanding her daughter’s perspective. She may see Waymond as child when it comes to managing a business, but she herself is a child at managing interpersonal relationships.

In conclusion, the beginning scenes of this film illustrate Evelyn’s precarious situation. She is on the verge of losing her marriage and her daughter’s heart. I’ve seen this quote attributed to Jung, *“Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will rule your life and you will call it Fate”*, and while I’m not 100% sure of its source, it certainly applies to Evelyn’s situation. She sees herself as a superwoman holding the household together with her powers of organisation, but she does not recognise her Inferior/Primitive Introverted Feeling, and it seems to her that all her efforts at interpersonal relationships turn into ash despite her organisational strengths.

In the following parts, I will look into Evelyn’s journey into the darkest corner of the ESTJ (Part 2), Waymond’s perspective and the film’s healthy portrayal of Dom Fi in INFP men (Part 3), and round off Evelyn’s journey as she develops her Inf Fi as an ESTJ (Part 4).

&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To re-describe the film in terms of the cognitive functions, Evelyn starts off with very poor usage of her Ter Ne and Inf Fi, and an inability to appreciate the Fi strengths of her INFP husband Waymond.

I agree with that.\n\nBut in casual conversation I will say that you have only 4 functions and that’s enough.\n\nWhy?\n\n1. It’s pretty easy to misunderstand functions and think that all MBTI is fake, or that it means nothing.\n2. Shadow functions don’t affect our lives.\n3. Everything that’s going on in your life can be explained by 4 functions.\n4. It’s hard to type people by using 8 functions. It’s not effective.\n5. Really, you use confidently only 4 functions (sometimes we’re even bad at those).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEVERYONE DOES EVERYTHING\n\nEveryone does everything. What does that mean? It means that you won’t find anyone who would say: “No, I never use logic”; “No, I never think about values”; “No, I never organize my stuff”; “No, I never thought about the future”; “No, I never listen to anyone”.\n\nThere is extraverted Feeling (Fe) and introverted Feeling (Fi). They’re obviously both Feeling. They each love to feel. Fe won’t say: “I don’t have my own emotions”, and Fi won’t say: “I wish to destroy the harmony around me”. They aren’t different. They just use a different strategy to get the same result.\n\nTe and Ti, Fe and Fi, Ne and Ni, Se and Si aren't so different.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIT IS EASY TO MISUNDERSTAND COMBINATIONS OF THE FUNCTIONS AS OTHER FUNCTIONS\n\nWhen you talk with someone and think: “OMG! He listens. He cares emotionally about what I say. He’s for sure a Fe-user”. Then you find out he isn’t a Fe-user. You guess it was a shadow mode. It wasn’t a shadow mode. It was natural curiosity, Se, along with personal Fi-judgment, that in combination looks like Fe.\n\nNe-Ti can look like Te.\n\nNi-Te can look like Ti.\n\nWe need to discover the actual reason behind their actions.\n\nI am almost 100% sure that this misunderstanding is due to their Cognitive Function test. They come to you and say: “But my cognitive function results say that I use my Shadow”. And then you hear: “You need to include that in your theory. You need to update it according to the trend”.\n\nBut you don’t need to think about how it looks — you need to find the reason.\n\n\\[Yeah, let’s use Oi and throw away Oe!… I mean, we can’t allow any bad Oe here!\\]\n\nI took that same test, and it showed that my most powerful function is Ti, and maybe for some people Ni-Te looks like Ti.\n\nFor example, I create a particular system, and it works, and it helps, and it gives real results, everyone sees it, yet you come to me with: “Why?” — I’ll slap you in the face, so you could have a real example of my function at work! 😉 Well… er… I mean, don’t be surprised that I don’t prefer digging-for-god-knows-what Ti, but instead I prefer some extraverted signs of Thinking (Te).\n\nYou’d say: “But there were building-blocks of Ti in your test result”. Well, there is in reality no Ti there, only Te. Do you need the correct test or the correct result?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHERE IS SO MUCH MEANING IN EACH FUNCTION!\n\nWhy would you think that 4 functions aren’t sufficient to describe you well? One function, Ni, combines so much, that it almost completely understands us.\n\nI mean, why would you drop so fast into allegory (describing not that thing, but a thing that is like that thing)? Ni!\n\nWhy aren’t you paying attention to the road/conversation/current situation? Ni!\n\nWhy are you so into that one particular idea, and bothering everyone around with MBTI? Ni!\n\nWhy do you plan where to exit your hotel room in case of a fire? Ni!\n\nOut-of-control Ni wants to know what the food is like without even tasting it. What’s coming next? How can I prepare myself for more? It’s always MORE, MORE, MORE!\n\nNo! We don’t need more obsessive weirdos.\n\nPeople always try to help their Demons (2 lowest functions) by overworking their Saviors (top 2 functions). They always, by always I mean always, think: “If I use my Dominant function even more, then my Inferior function will take care of itself.”\n\nNo. How do you hope to develop your Se, if your Ni is on steroids, trying to control everything? How many hours per week do you really use your Se? Do you overprepare or actually can live in chaos of real world Se?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd all that info is combined in one Ni (without Se).\n\n\\[Btw, I found an example of overpreparing Thinker [https://youtu.be/eEsbsIbCCXs](https://youtu.be/eEsbsIbCCXs)\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIT’S EASIER, FASTER, AND MORE ACCURATE TO TYPE USING 4 FUNCTIONS\n\nMBTI says that you can’t rely on your shadow functions. You can’t use them without being fake. If you want to update that system, suggest something provable. Because I can explain all your shadow modes using the standard Cognitive function stack.\n\nIn reality, it’s way easier to type using 4 functions. I’m able to choose the top details from someone’s speech, and that would be enough to do typing. It’s fast and accurate, and it helps to clarify MBTI. While you with your 8-function model might say: “I still don’t know what their type is”.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWE CAN’T RELY ON SHADOW FUNCTIONS, BECAUSE SHADOWS ARE SUPER-EXHAUSTING\n\nDon’t get me wrong. It’s still quite interesting to see where you are strange, or how people with opposite functions act, or what we overlook all the time.\n\nI just found a nice example, where it can be a Shadow in me. \\[btw, you can join the contest\\]\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyINFJs/comments/xs6i7u/comment/iqqfchj/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyINFJs/comments/xs6i7u/comment/iqqfchj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n&gt;Well, if you won’t submit a design then you won't have a contest, right? (Te) 😊  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Just think, how do you want this sub to look? (Fi)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Inner voice 1: Bimep, this is not near the Fe-Ti! (looks like critic Ti)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Inner voice 2: So what?\n\nThat critic Ti always sounds like a grumpy old character, hated by everyone in the family, because he only likes to say: “This is bad. This is wrong. This is inaccurate” even if it has nothing to do with current work.\n\nBut anyway, only my normal Cognitive function stack can deal with that critic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nINFJs are Te-blind. It’s true. And they never seem to notice that.\n\nTime after time not noticing irritates others, and those others are like: “How is it that you couldn’t put those two ideas (two logic) together and compare them? You have a step-by-step method how to literally do that! Why da heck didn’t you do that — just because someone told you something?”. All the 7th functions are like so.\n\nWhat do INFJs have? They have Fe and they have Ti. INFJs are highly aware of the right word (Ni) that will play the best on your emotions (Fe), and all of that is built on hard, cold logic (Ti) and probably even has a sense of the real world (Se). They won’t manage the work, but they can manage the people who manage the work. INFJs use Fe+Ti, and it really gives them the result that they need, so why would they need Te?\n\nWhy are you trying so hard to get Te from them? It super-exhausts them. If you see an INFJ occasionally doing something with Te, you should be grateful and thank them for that. But if you expect that from them every day, you should realize that it’s not gonna happen. That would be the beginning of the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat’s the point in trying to get Fi from an ExTP? They think logically (Ti) and they care about you (Fe). Why would you want to overload them with Fi when they don’t even need it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy try to get Fe from IxTJ? They do something that works for you (Te) and it’s morally right (Fi), so that automatically makes it socially good (Fe).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, give them some slack, Shadow functions is not who they are. =)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks u/[JackieAutoimmuneINFJ](https://www.reddit.com/chat/channel/379698002_dc1568074cbe02b59c490c8ce1198cf8c7f15706) for styling the text =)"", 'author_fullname': 't2_s76efr8t', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Prove me wrong.

Then, I would love to hear how PTSD and Si are related for all types.  You do not need to share your personal experiences of what caused your PTSD, but I am curious how it may manifest differently for each type.  \n\n\nIntroverted Sensing (Si):\n\n* Homeostasis: Body Temperature, Hunger, Emotions, etc.\n* Fight, Flight, Freeze ***Response***: Goosebumps, Hair Standing on End, Racing Heart, etc. \\[Fight, flight, freeze ***decisions*** are made by introverted feeling (Fi)\\]\n* Long-Term Memory:\n   * Explicit Memory (actively recalled):\n      * Semantic Memory (details, data, dates, names, etc)\n      * Episodic Memory (past personal experiences)\n   * Implicit Memory (passively recalled):\n      * Procedural Skills &amp; Habits (Muscle Memory)\n      * **Respondent (Classical) Conditioning (Think Pavlov)**\n      * Non-Associative (Habituation) Learning\n      * Priming\n* Bonds/Loyalty: Lasting Impressions &amp; Imprinting, Attachments (Spiritual Cords) **(This can also be negative impressions from trauma/abuse resulting in PTSD where a piece of you is trapped in the past and when that memory gets triggered you are reliving a past event rather than truly perceiving what is happening in that very moment.**\n* Consistency: Routines &amp; Traditions\n* Time Period - Past: What happened before?\n\nPTSD is usually triggered by extraverted sensing (Se) as the sensing functions are on an axis with each other.  These triggers can be a word/phrase, a sound, a smell, a touch, a taste, etc.  Usually it hits one of your 5 senses that then triggers a memory pulling you back into a state of mind when the trauma occurred and thus, you are no longer truly experiencing the moment, but sort of reliving the past.  This type of memory recall is an implicit memory that is passively recalled.  For example, many soldiers with PTSD from war really struggle with fireworks or when a car backfires and they are literally thrown back into being on the battlefield inside their mind.  This is an extreme form where you are literally seeing the battlefield and the other soldiers...it's a hallucination where the memory is projected out into reality.  PTSD does not need to be this extreme.  You may just relive the feeling and get hostile, angry, irritated, or annoyed by something completely innocent.    \n\n\nThese triggers do not need to be logically connected and most are not.  It's a form of classical conditional where an unrelated item triggers a response in someone.  If you take Pavlov's dog who heard a bell and was then given food.  After x amount of times, just by hearing the bell the dog would salivate expecting food even before it was given.  It is the same thing for PTSD, but in a negative response.  Say Pavlov rang the bell and then placed a stick in front of the dog.  At first he may throw the stick to play fetch and the dog would form a bond or an attachment to Pavlov (think of this like love bombing).  But then instead of throwing the stick, Pavlov starting hitting the dog with the stick.  At first when he heard the bell, he would get excited to play.  But after being struck with the stick, now he is hesitant with the bell.  After enough times, the dog would cower in fear and pain or lash out and try to bite Pavlov just by hearing the bell.  This is PTSD as a result of conditioning.  If an experience is traumatic enough (which is very subjective) you do not need to experience an event multiple times for it to result in PTSD.    \n\n\nIn order to heal from PTSD, you must learn what your triggers are and disconnect the unrelated item from the traumatic event.  That way when you see a random stick or hear a firework explode, you are not thrown back into the past.  \n\n\nI'm working on a YouTube video about this very topic, but would like to hear input from all personality types on how they experience PTSD and how they have recovered from PTSD.  It could also just be how you experience being triggered and if you can recognize it when it is happening or not.  \n\n\nThanks!"", 'author_fullname': 't2_fp4vfoup', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'PTSD &amp; Introverted Sensing (Si) [Trigger Warning]', 'link_flair_richtext': [{'e': 'text', 't': 'Theory Discussion'}], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/mbti', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': '', 'downs': 0, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_yry7z0', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 0.92, 'author_flair_background_color': '#73ad34', 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 22, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': '4584fa56-4607-11e6-ab65-0e724eed375d', 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'Theory Discussion', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 22, 'approved_by': None, 'is_created_from_ads_ui': False, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': 'infj', 'author_flair_richtext': [{'e': 'text', 't': 'INFJ'}], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1668131877.0, 'link_flair_type': 'richtext', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'richtext', 'domain': 'self.mbti', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, I&amp;#39;d like to share my explanation of Si as it may be different from what you think.

* worked directly as staff and directing roles in bars and restaurants, 
* have been studying and practicing as an architect / building engineer and manager for quite some time. both in organisations as self-directing. 

All these functions and roles have a big role for ""fixing stuff¨. like a to do list to just make that drawing,  keep that customer happy, fix all the 500 foreseeable and unforeseeable aspects in both preparation and execution of a wedding as the location host., never stressful, but ""in the flow""  All this with a big role to do it as efficiently as possible. certain aspects have a decisive aspect on the whole, like costs, contentment of stakeholders like customers and employees and myself, quality, time. etc. That is kind of how my head works, pretty consciously even because I'm not an ESTJ, most of the time in these kind of situations. 

Now here is the thing, I like it, I use these skills in many other situations as well, but it never feels ""intrinsic"".

at my best, it gives me so much energy to do this stuff that the activity itself is (more than) the reward. I am like a machine that can keep going on the good vibes that I create by ""just doing stuff""

,ESTJ,"The other kind of mental process identified by Jung is judgment, a process of organising and evaluating information, and coming to conclusions. Using the judging process, some sort of evaluation is made and Jung identified two kinds of judgment: Thinking and Feeling. The T-F dichotomy is our ‘output’ scale - ie how we each make decisions.

Both of these can be used in either the outer, extraverted world or in the inner, introverted world. Thinking judgments are based on objective criteria or principles, as Jung describes:

*...judgement is reserved as to what significance should be attached to the facts in question. And on this significance will depend the way in which the individual deals with the facts.*

Feeling judgments are based on personal, interpersonal, or emotional values as Jung describes:

*...adaptation will depend entirely on the feeling value he attributes to them.*

Thinking types tend to make their decisions based on data, evidence and rational thought. They tend to be pragmatic and not swayed by antipathies or emotions but prefer empirical data.

,ESTJ,"We all hate reading walls of text, so I'll keep it short. I used to be able to easily cry whenever I felt upset/sad/whatever. I'd cry in private, never in front of anyone. As I got older, I noticed I cried less and less, thinking that's part of growing up too and having been gone to therapy for childhood trauma. Healed from the worst shit from my past, but some things still linger but not as bad. I am no longer depressed.

But I noticed since the last month or so, I have literally unable to cry. I feel pent up emotions, they're clearly there. And some shit happened lately and I haven't really been happy for a few months for several reasons. And whenever I feel like I am about to cry, I just don't. And I never had this issue before. It's like I cannot release/express myself, well my negative emotions. I feel kind of hollow, empty,... Like I have nothing left in me anymore to pour out. I just feel like ""crying won't change shit"" and just accept whatever happens in my life. But it also makes me feel shit but even when I want to cry, nothing happens. I feel it coming up but right when the tears should roll down, they just don't.

Anyone else been through something like this? I've always been shit expressing my feelings to others but I have gotten a lot better at it.

It is automatically good. \\[In fact, it would be nice to put some kind of brakes on it!\\]\n\n*Auxiliary* is also very powerful.\n\n*Tertiary* — could be better, but still works pretty well.\n\n*Inferior* — usually we don\'t load this function properly, so we have a problem in our life because of that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecond and third functions work in balance about 60/40. They’re pretty even.\n\nFirst and fourth are used about 90/10. You see? Fourth is used only about 10% of the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when you’re typing someone, you look for that disproportion.\n\nYou look to see if the person is crazy\n\n1. about **info/things** (constantly missing the information, “control” vs “chaos” SN) or\n2. about **people** (constant problems with people, “me” vs. “tribe” TF).\n\nChoose your crazy group. =)\n\nThen you check to see if the person is a Jumper \\[see the Dictionary [https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyINFJs/comments/xq5i6p/dictionary\\_if\\_you\\_struggle\\_with\\_understanding\\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyINFJs/comments/xq5i6p/dictionary_if_you_struggle_with_understanding_an/) \\].\n\nAfter that you play with functions: Ni or Ne, Fi or Ti, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is OP based stuff. I crossposted it before [https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyINFJs/comments/xanui6/observers\\_and\\_deciders/](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyINFJs/comments/xanui6/observers_and_deciders/)\n\nSo now I’ll just repeat all of that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can’t type based on: “I do this, and I do that”. Of course, everybody does everything. Notice where someone actually spends the most of their time.\n\nTheir imbalance between Dominant and Inferior function will be so big, that it isn’t just: “This is a problem”, but it will be: “OMG! This is a catastrophe! Now I’m dead!”. Most of their energy will be spent here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# OBSERVERS\n\nObservers (ExxP and IxxJ) feel trapped in a recurring Magic show: ""Where did it disappear to?""; “When I bought that car, I thought it had X, but now I see it doesn’t.”; “Oh! I thought there were mushrooms in the back yard, but now I see that those are just leaves that look like mushrooms.”; “Where did I put that?”; “I lost my key!”; “What does that mean? What’s the hidden meaning behind that?”; “I don’t see it.”; “I don’t understand that, so it can’t be real.”; “Illuminati are after me!” Observers live in Jumanji.\n\n— they ask someone\'s name and forget it the next second,\n\n— they easily get bored,\n\n— when you take their stuff, it’s like you took their soul,\n\n— they are triggered if something like the printer doesn’t work.\n\nAll of that means that they’re perceiving only half of all the information. (Did you catch what I’m saying here, or were you zoned out? 😉)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir mindset is, “*The rarest thing in the world is information*.”\n\nJust literally yesterday Jackie told me, “Noticing is 90% of wisdom.” As if quoted just out of a book, haha. Why 90%? Why info? It’s not about thinking and logic, it’s about noticing.\n\nObservers are pretty balanced with T and F. Do you know where they shine? In finding the compromise, because they look at a problem with their eyes and through the eyes of another human. They have that continuous dialog in their head.\n\nObservers love to argue about politics. They will gladly go on a rant about government, because it’s fun for them. Because it’s about people, and they’re not the least bit afraid of people.\n\nThey can say “F you” and don’t get upset about that, because they realize they know where to stop, and they are sure in that skill. Like, “Do you want to wish Happy Birthday to your grandma?” — “Yeah. Grandma, you have 4 months to live.”\n\nWhen Observers tell a story, people descriptions are usually vague. The characters are like blurry figures, like “some guy” or “that was XXXX” and that’s it. Who cares about people? Observers are busy processing if they’re on the right path or the wrong one. “Is this the right path? Is this real?”\n\nPeople can often be a problem for Observers, but not too much: “Eh, it is hard, but I can deal with that.” It’s not the end of their life!\n\nBut why are they angry at people? Because the people didn’t give the Observer enough info: ""You didn\'t tell me!"" Also, when you argue with them, they don’t need your amazing logic, it’s 99% that they need to understand if your view is real.\n\nObservers are obsessed with telling the truth: “I’m young, but I won’t keep silent. I see what’s going on. I’m telling you the truth, and you will listen to me!” And when you listen to them, it feels like you made a deal with someone who does monster drugs.\n\nYou might even know them for 20 years, and in those 20 years the biggest thing for them is sending you links with the text: “Look.” \\[Like I do all the time)\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, Observers finally come up with *the secret missing information:* “You should greatly value the treasure of observation and discovery. If you don’t, then probably it’s because of being in the wrong environment, like when you’re not allowed to ask questions. \\[If you ask them, they’ll say that they’re angry because of people, but not things!\\] Observers think: “Everybody’s too cool! Everybody wants you to think they know something. But they don’t!” \\[They aren’t afraid of people, they really want to interact with people to get their information.\\] “Everything that people propose is search and find. So you should value your ability to do that!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# DECIDERS\n\nDeciders (ExxJ or IxxP) of course would be offended because someone stole their phone! Yes, it’s also a problem for them, but the disaster won’t be so huge as for Observers. Problems for the Deciders are people.\n\nThose who often screw up with people think: ""I\'d better spend extra time learning by myself, doing my own research, so I don’t need to ask anyone else for what I need.”\n\nIf they argue about something, in the end it’ll always will be about someone else: “This is because of Timmy! This is his fault!” Even if you have no idea who Timmy is, Deciders have a need to talk about him.\n\nIf you have a conversation about politics or something similar, they will be: “Please, don’t talk to that person. Please, leave him alone.”\n\nEverything is because of people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDeciders have big swings between, ""Who am I? What do I want?” and “Do people like what I do? Does it work for them?”. Observers in this regard move as on a superhighway. They have several lanes where they can switch, but they don’t wander off the road. On the other hand, Deciders move deliberately down the center, and if they deviate, that pushes them too far — “Nobody loves me, nobody needs me. Everyone around me is bad"" or ""I\'m a piece of \\*\\*\\*”.\n\nThese are also called Single Deciders, because they decide something once and don’t reconsider it ever: “Done! This is what I said. That’s my final word.” Their decision is an infinity thing, otherwise there is a darkness for them. They are super-terrified to be wrong, or to have been lied to. They cope this way: “I don’t want to be cut off, so I will forever say that this is bullshit or fake news.” It’s very hard to change their point of view.\n\nDeciders are also weird when they find that everybody else in the world are assholes, but some people are sweet. Deciders say: “I thought you were XXXX, I saw XXXX, you acted like XXXX, but you make me feel you’re human. Only your few close people know that you’re not XXXX, but human.” Observers will be like: “Eh, yeah, of course. It’s obvious, so let’s get back to information!”, but for this Decider it’s really about the discovery.\n\nHere’s an author’s example of discovery: “One of the most important lessons I’ve learned about sales is that you meet the customers where they are, not where you are. If I think my book is great, I can walk around the whole day saying, \\`This is the best book ever!’ But, if I don’t consider my readers — what they think, what they feel — and if I don’t ask myself what is good for them and what works for them, I’ll end up with a book that only I like and nobody else does.\n\nAlso, I found there are different types of criticism: helpful educational criticism, thoughtful and kind criticism, and just plain old criticism when people just want to bang their keyboard. At first, it’s actually painful to hear criticism. But being all online, having your life visible, you have to be a little skeptical about anything that’s said about you. Reading all the compliments it’s easy to believe: “Oh, that’s me. I’m cool!”, but remember — it’s possibly not even true. Yes, I want to hear helpful criticism. Yes, I want to hear the validation, but I also want a certain amount of kind thoughtfulness.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe whole story of human life is about finding the connection between the first and fourth functions. When they do find that connection, they become famous. Why? Because most people aren’t good in their 4th function, because it’s such a struggle to learn how to use it. We don’t go to Ni-doms to ask about using Ni because they don’t think about it — they simply use it automatically. So we go to Se-doms who developed their Ni, because they really know how it works. They fought for that. They went through hell to reach that.\n\nNo one is as generous as ExTJ (there is even a saying ""royal gesture"")\n\nNo one is as smart as ExFJ\n\nNo one is as perceptive as ESxP\n\nNo one is as organized as ENxP\n\nNo one is as creative as ISxJ (for real, look at r/ISTJ! They were tasked with making a creative avatar, so they screened it up and put it on as their avatar. It\'s the most creative thing I\'ve seen!)\n\nNo one is as brave as INxJ\n\nNo one is as caring as IxTP\n\nNo one can run a business as well as IxFP\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what is your story?

Because the people didn’t give the Observer enough info: &amp;quot;You didn&amp;#39;t tell me!&amp;quot; Also, when you argue with them, they don’t need your amazing logic, it’s 99% that they need to understand if your view is real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Observers are obsessed with telling the truth: “I’m young, but I won’t keep silent. I see what’s going on. I’m telling you the truth, and you will listen to me!” And when you listen to them, it feels like you made a deal with someone who does monster drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might even know them for 20 years, and in those 20 years the biggest thing for them is sending you links with the text: “Look.” [Like I do all the time)]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the end, Observers finally come up with &lt;em&gt;the secret missing information:&lt;/em&gt; “You should greatly value the treasure of observation and discovery. If you don’t, then probably it’s because of being in the wrong environment, like when you’re not allowed to ask questions. [If you ask them, they’ll say that they’re angry because of people, but not things!] Observers think: “Everybody’s too cool! Everybody wants you to think they know something. But they don’t!” [They aren’t afraid of people, they really want to interact with people to get their information.] “Everything that people propose is search and find. So you should value your ability to do that!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;DECIDERS&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deciders (ExxJ or IxxP) of course would be offended because someone stole their phone! Yes, it’s also a problem for them, but the disaster won’t be so huge as for Observers. Problems for the Deciders are people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those who often screw up with people think: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d better spend extra time learning by myself, doing my own research, so I don’t need to ask anyone else for what I need.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they argue about something, in the end it’ll always will be about someone else: “This is because of Timmy! This is his fault!” Even if you have no idea who Timmy is, Deciders have a need to talk about him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have a conversation about politics or something similar, they will be: “Please, don’t talk to that person. Please, leave him alone.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything is because of people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deciders have big swings between, &amp;quot;Who am I? What do I want?” and “Do people like what I do? Does it work for them?”. Observers in this regard move as on a superhighway. They have several lanes where they can switch, but they don’t wander off the road. On the other hand, Deciders move deliberately down the center, and if they deviate, that pushes them too far — “Nobody loves me, nobody needs me. Everyone around me is bad&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a piece of ***”.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are also called Single Deciders, because they decide something once and don’t reconsider it ever: “Done! This is what I said. That’s my final word.” Their decision is an infinity thing, otherwise there is a darkness for them. They are super-terrified to be wrong, or to have been lied to. They cope this way: “I don’t want to be cut off, so I will forever say that this is bullshit or fake news.” It’s very hard to change their point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deciders are also weird when they find that everybody else in the world are assholes, but some people are sweet. Deciders say: “I thought you were XXXX, I saw XXXX, you acted like XXXX, but you make me feel you’re human. Only your few close people know that you’re not XXXX, but human.” Observers will be like: “Eh, yeah, of course. It’s obvious, so let’s get back to information!”, but for this Decider it’s really about the discovery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here’s an author’s example of discovery: “One of the most important lessons I’ve learned about sales is that you meet the customers where they are, not where you are. If I think my book is great, I can walk around the whole day saying, `This is the best book ever!’ But, if I don’t consider my readers — what they think, what they feel — and if I don’t ask myself what is good for them and what works for them, I’ll end up with a book that only I like and nobody else does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I found there are different types of criticism: helpful educational criticism, thoughtful and kind criticism, and just plain old criticism when people just want to bang their keyboard. At first, it’s actually painful to hear criticism. But being all online, having your life visible, you have to be a little skeptical about anything that’s said about you. Reading all the compliments it’s easy to believe: “Oh, that’s me. I’m cool!”, but remember — it’s possibly not even true. Yes, I want to hear helpful criticism. Yes, I want to hear the validation, but I also want a certain amount of kind thoughtfulness.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole story of human life is about finding the connection between the first and fourth functions. When they do find that connection, they become famous. Why? Because most people aren’t good in their 4th function, because it’s such a struggle to learn how to use it. We don’t go to Ni-doms to ask about using Ni because they don’t think about it — they simply use it automatically. So we go to Se-doms who developed their Ni, because they really know how it works. They fought for that. They went through hell to reach that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one is as generous as ExTJ (there is even a saying &amp;quot;royal gesture&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one is as smart as ExFJ&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one is as perceptive as ESxP&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one is as organized as ENxP&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one is as creative as ISxJ (for real, look at &lt;a href=""/r/ISTJ""&gt;r/ISTJ&lt;/a&gt;! They were tasked with making a creative avatar, so they screened it up and put it on as their avatar. It&amp;#39;s the most creative thing I&amp;#39;ve seen!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one is as brave as INxJ&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one is as caring as IxTP&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one can run a business as well as IxFP&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what is your story?

,ESTJ,"First of all just let me say that this isn't in the near future, it's just an idea that I have and I need a business plan for my second to last week at college (16 months from now).

I have some basic ideas but I'd like to fine tune them and ace this project when it comes up. I want to be prepared.

Right now I'm looking at menu ideas, recipes and food handling guidelines. The technical side is just as important.

The first item will be the menu, since this is a plan for a brick and mortar bakery I'm looking at specialty cakes; birthdays, weddings, anniversaries etc. Cupcakes, donuts, different varieties of bread; apple cinnamon, banana, chocolate etc. Cookies, and I'm planning on buying bulk French pastries to bake and resell. The first thing I'll need is a website for my business that includes the menu items, I'm also thinking of getting a rough draft of an in-house menu design, how descriptive do  want the individual items to be, how much will they cost with all my expenses? How will I turn a profit? Things of that nature.

As far as recipes go, I'm planning on using some recipes I found on YouTube and tweaking them a bit to make them my own. Think like a chewier cookie or a softer muffin. I also plan on practicing and experimenting with the ingredients to get different textures, chew, crisp and sweetness in my own personal kitchen.

As for food safety, permits and licensing goes I'm planning on having proper food handling instructions available at every work station as well as reminders to wash hands. I'll need at least 6 bakers; 3 morning, 3 evening, 6 cashiers (more as the company expands), 4 dish washers, 2 greeters and 8-12 servers, as we'll as 4 managers and 6 shift leaders.. Each employee will undergo food handling training as well as maintaining a safe work environment. As for permits and licenses, I need a business license ($100-250), an Employer Identification Number (free), resale permit ($0-50), food handlers permit ($5-30), Building Health Permit ($50-1,000), Dumpster Placement Permit ($10-100/week), food service license ($100-1,000), sign permit ($20-50), certificate of occupancy ($100). [$2,830 start-up cost]

For advertising we will use all forms of social media as well as operating at local farmers markets and renting tables, where we will sell and offer free samples of our products. We will also offer tote bags, t-shirts and hats with our company logo to get free advertisements.

That's my proposal for the moment, remember this isn't something that's going to happen over night. This is just a rough draft and I would appreciate any advise you'd be willing to share.

&lt;p&gt;The first item will be the menu, since this is a plan for a brick and mortar bakery I&amp;#39;m looking at specialty cakes; birthdays, weddings, anniversaries etc. Cupcakes, donuts, different varieties of bread; apple cinnamon, banana, chocolate etc. Cookies, and I&amp;#39;m planning on buying bulk French pastries to bake and resell. The first thing I&amp;#39;ll need is a website for my business that includes the menu items, I&amp;#39;m also thinking of getting a rough draft of an in-house menu design, how descriptive do  want the individual items to be, how much will they cost with all my expenses? How will I turn a profit? Things of that nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as recipes go, I&amp;#39;m planning on using some recipes I found on YouTube and tweaking them a bit to make them my own. Think like a chewier cookie or a softer muffin. I also plan on practicing and experimenting with the ingredients to get different textures, chew, crisp and sweetness in my own personal kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for food safety, permits and licensing goes I&amp;#39;m planning on having proper food handling instructions available at every work station as well as reminders to wash hands. I&amp;#39;ll need at least 6 bakers; 3 morning, 3 evening, 6 cashiers (more as the company expands), 4 dish washers, 2 greeters and 8-12 servers, as we&amp;#39;ll as 4 managers and 6 shift leaders.. Each employee will undergo food handling training as well as maintaining a safe work environment. As for permits and licenses, I need a business license ($100-250), an Employer Identification Number (free), resale permit ($0-50), food handlers permit ($5-30), Building Health Permit ($50-1,000), Dumpster Placement Permit ($10-100/week), food service license ($100-1,000), sign permit ($20-50), certificate of occupancy ($100). [$2,830 start-up cost]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For advertising we will use all forms of social media as well as operating at local farmers markets and renting tables, where we will sell and offer free samples of our products. We will also offer tote bags, t-shirts and hats with our company logo to get free advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s my proposal for the moment, remember this isn&amp;#39;t something that&amp;#39;s going to happen over night. This is just a rough draft and I would appreciate any advise you&amp;#39;d be willing to share. I just want to knock this out of the park!&lt;/p&gt;

,ESTJ,"Just wondering about this. When I was younger and in all my previous relationships, I put feelings/emotions over logic. I'd date some random losers while I objectively realised the big red flags from day one but ignored them in favor of my feelings for them. Funnily enough I was always the one dumping all my exes due to a lot of ""logical"" reasons. Stuff like partners who refused to get a job, didn't help with the chores, couldn't make phone calls for e.g. dentists appointments because they were too ""scared"" to do it, etc... I mostly had indecisive partners too who didn't really know what they were doing in life and that really bothered me. Most relationships I had lasted 3-6 months. No real long term relationship. I ended them because I just got too pissed off and impatient with their overall incompetence at the most basic adult tasks in life.

Now I am 28 and I feel like I properly see the aforementioned red flags way better and actually don't date purely out of feelings anymore. I've rejected 3 guys who asked me out on a date this year alone while I would have given such people a chance in the past. I just immediately scan for stuff like ""do they have a stable job and income? What do they do? Can they cook/clean?"" etc... I think a lot more practical when I consider seeing/dating someone and if they do not check a certain amount of boxes I have in mind, I don't even give them a chance.

A lot of people say that is not ""very romantic"". Despite this, I am still extremely romantic when I'm actually in a relationship, super loving and caressing. I just feel smarter in a way when it comes to dating and don't date men who clearly have heavy issues or big red flags anymore. I want a partner who helps lift me up instead of someone dragging me down. I used to exclusively date ""broken men"" on top of everything else, so yeah. I feel so much happier since I've stopped doing that.

,ESTJ,"You are the director of several companies. You have a manager directly under you and an assistant manager managed by your manager and you. You are overseas and not able to be at office and on top of things due to COVID situation, you have frequent contact with your manager and you catch-up with your manager and assistant manager weekly. You do the manager's appraisal and your manager does the assistant manager's. Therefore, you don't really work closely with the assistant manager and most info you get about the assistant manager is only from your manager.

One day, the assistant manager requests a call with you in private, without the manager.

,ESTJ," Hey guys!

Out of curiosity I am doing a poll on the drug preferences of the different MBTI personality types. I couldn't really find a proper poll or study on this topic with numbers so I'm doing it myself. This poll doesn't take much time so I would be happy if you would answer it ;)

You can participate, if you think this poll would yield interesting results and you have experience with different substances.

If you are morally opposed to the consumption of drugs (legal or non-legal), please do **NOT** participate and manipulate the results.

In case that I actually get enough data to make a propper graph/table/etc. I will post it on [r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/) and update it, if needed.

The poll will be anonymous and I will be the only person that will be reviewing the answers.

,ESTJ,"Just a random question that popped up in my head. I used to have really bad attachment issues. I'd be 'friends with everyone' usually or very easily. And I was always dating, seeing, sleeping,... with a guy. I went into therapy in my early 20s and worked trough a lot of my traumatic upbringing. Then also spent years on my own training myself in a way to be aware of my issues and get better. All in all I think I spent almost a decade working on myself after I became suicidal at 15 (never tried anything, mostly non-stop intrusive thoughts).

I am 28 now and recently went to therapy again. Not for issues but because I thought maybe it could help improve myself overall again. But after 5-6 months they already said I don't have to come anymore as I seem to really have my life and myself together and I have no big issues left anymore. And for the first time in my life am I not trying hard to date, fuck, see or even like a guy anymore. This used to be a constant obsession of mine, or rather a distraction from my problems. I always NEEDED someone to daydream about every single day. And this is the first time I don't feel that as a ""need"" anymore and I am just happy as I am, a single pringle. And I genuinely don't mind being alone. Having or not having a partner doesn't determine my happiness or self worth anymore.

I was wondering if any other ESTJ's have or had attachment issues. I think it is kind of funny as people see us as stoic and cold, distant people. But the way I used to get unhealthily attached to people is the complete opposite, I'd be extremely involved and very warm and sweet (still am to loved ones).

We know we can count on our Saviors, because we know how well we can use them. We also know we will be successful because leaning on them doesn’t exhaust us. It’s even fun sometimes to show off our dominant function. Why can’t other people do that too?\n\n**Demons (3rd and 4th functions)**\n\nWhen we talk about something that requires our Tertiary and/or Inferior function, we’re talking about SERIOUS topics. (\\*We don’t ban anyone for addressing serious issues here, but if you’re in your Demons, at least try not to sound crabby or condescending\\*). This is hard, we know that, and we recognize that we are bad at that, because it takes real effort to confront our Demons. When we see that other people are good at our Demons, we feel insecure. For example, my Inferior function is Se. I don\'t like it, but I see that other people use it well. They’re good at Se, and I know that I’m bad at that. Other people ask me, ""Why can\'t you do such a simple task?"" — this is scary for me, because Se is outside my comfort zone.\n\nBy the way, all successful people exhibit self-control, meaning they’re able to use their 3rd and 4th functions along with their 1st and 2nd. That means that they focus their energy on their Saviors while covering their weaknesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Consume First (Oe+Di)**\n\nThis means that this personality perceives a lot of information (Oe). Who for? For themselves (Di). They’re someone who wakes up in the morning and reaches for their phone to check out what’s going on, and checks, checks, checks. Or if they read a book, or study a particular subject, they won’t stop researching until they know everything about it.\n\n**Blast First (Oi+De)**\n\nThis personality reads 3 pages from a new book and instantly says, “OMG! This is the best thing ever. Everybody should know about this!” It’s teaching, directing, giving their opinion, appearing an “expert”, learning as they go, processing the same info over and over. It’s someone who wants to see results. When do they want to see them? NOW!\n\n**Sleep First (Oi+Di)**\n\n“I know, that even if I have the worst Se around me —if the world goes crazy, if everything is bad — I can create my own nice, safe and orderly world in my head. Somehow what is inside us is able to affect the world around us. I don’t understand how it works, but it does work. And if it’s not the case yet, but I can picture it happening, then I can make it become a reality. Why do we continually try to create an ideal situation using the same old tools and following the same old methods? Why not try to picture your ideal situation, and then figure out how to create it in our real world?”\n\n**Play First (Oe+De)**\n\nThis is a very energetic person, very enthusiastic, like “Go! Go! Go!”. Someone who brings up 7 topics in like 2 minutes. The other person is like a cat that you’re trying to catch in a bag, because you need to keep to your topic in order to get something out of this conversation. But by continually changing the subject, the Player is constantly trying to jump out. This personality spends a lot of energy and effort.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPD:\n\nEnergy dom = Sleep + Play in the top 3 Animals\n\nInfo dom = Consume + Blast in the top 3 Animals\n\n(Source https://youtu.be/CXs3ZTgewZw )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh sure, I know you’re unique and you can accomplish anything! But you will do it in your own particular way, so first you need to find out what your strengths are. Honestly, you can’t type yourself, because you can’t observe yourself.

We know we can count on our Saviors, because we know how well we can use them. We also know we will be successful because leaning on them doesn’t exhaust us. It’s even fun sometimes to show off our dominant function. Why can’t other people do that too?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demons (3rd and 4th functions)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we talk about something that requires our Tertiary and/or Inferior function, we’re talking about SERIOUS topics. (*We don’t ban anyone for addressing serious issues here, but if you’re in your Demons, at least try not to sound crabby or condescending*). This is hard, we know that, and we recognize that we are bad at that, because it takes real effort to confront our Demons. When we see that other people are good at our Demons, we feel insecure. For example, my Inferior function is Se. I don&amp;#39;t like it, but I see that other people use it well. They’re good at Se, and I know that I’m bad at that. Other people ask me, &amp;quot;Why can&amp;#39;t you do such a simple task?&amp;quot; — this is scary for me, because Se is outside my comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, all successful people exhibit self-control, meaning they’re able to use their 3rd and 4th functions along with their 1st and 2nd. That means that they focus their energy on their Saviors while covering their weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consume First (Oe+Di)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This means that this personality perceives a lot of information (Oe). Who for? For themselves (Di). They’re someone who wakes up in the morning and reaches for their phone to check out what’s going on, and checks, checks, checks. Or if they read a book, or study a particular subject, they won’t stop researching until they know everything about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blast First (Oi+De)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This personality reads 3 pages from a new book and instantly says, “OMG! This is the best thing ever. Everybody should know about this!” It’s teaching, directing, giving their opinion, appearing an “expert”, learning as they go, processing the same info over and over. It’s someone who wants to see results. When do they want to see them? NOW!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep First (Oi+Di)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I know, that even if I have the worst Se around me —if the world goes crazy, if everything is bad — I can create my own nice, safe and orderly world in my head. Somehow what is inside us is able to affect the world around us. I don’t understand how it works, but it does work. And if it’s not the case yet, but I can picture it happening, then I can make it become a reality. Why do we continually try to create an ideal situation using the same old tools and following the same old methods? Why not try to picture your ideal situation, and then figure out how to create it in our real world?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play First (Oe+De)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a very energetic person, very enthusiastic, like “Go! Go! Go!”. Someone who brings up 7 topics in like 2 minutes. The other person is like a cat that you’re trying to catch in a bag, because you need to keep to your topic in order to get something out of this conversation. But by continually changing the subject, the Player is constantly trying to jump out. This personality spends a lot of energy and effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;UPD:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Energy dom = Sleep + Play in the top 3 Animals&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Info dom = Consume + Blast in the top 3 Animals&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Source &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/CXs3ZTgewZw""&gt;https://youtu.be/CXs3ZTgewZw&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh sure, I know you’re unique and you can accomplish anything!

,ESTJ,"Hey

I took the official mbti test and tested as an ESTJ. Didnt think I would have gotten ESTJ. I thought ESTP or maybe ENTJ. 
Anyways after reading about the cognitive functions and more in depth descriptions of ESTJ's it sounds a lot like me. However some things I noticed were absent in the descriptions.

I am a huge nerd for the fantasy, sci fi and horror genre(movies,books,tv,games). I play dnd and love video games.

I'm a metal and punk fan. Didnt know of any xstj musicians. Can't find any online.

I'm rebellious not for the sake of it although when I was younger I was. I have no problem standing up for myself or others. 

OTHER RANDOM INFO


I point out discrepancies when i see them or if something doesnt make sense. I'm told I can be pretty black and white even though I consider myself open minded.

My humor is whatever What We Do in the Shadows and Mystery Science Theatre 3000 is.

I like reviews(it doesn't deter me if the review is bad as I can make my own judgement) but there's a youtuber called beyondthetrailer I like the way the reviews are laid out by category. I lay out things very similarly.

My wife(intp) I'm more logic/reason minded. I do like science though. It's what helped me come out of religion.

I'm an athiest and I'm very liberal in a family of born again Christians and conservatives. I left home at 17 to not have to be around it. I came out of religion around 13 and it was hell until I left. Religion just doesn't compute with my brain.

I quote movies or TV shows throughout the day

I have a morning routine that I hate being interrupted. If it is I go right back to it asap

Politics interest me and I enjoy debating

I hate being micro managed

Work first play later. I will get all the non fun stuff out of the way asap to be able to relax.

Short tempered, always have been

Facts are important to me

Do jigsaw puzzles frequently and read

I dont sugar coat anything

Dependable and loyal

Tattooed and heavily in the tattoo scene itself

,ESTJ,"28yo woman here. So I am in a predicament for the past few years and I have been thinking a lot about it. Currently I plan to save more money for many reasons for the next year or two so I still have time to make up my mind.

On to the issue. I have two bachelor degrees in my country in the social work field. I mostly enjoy the administration work I do and help people get justice that way rather than face to face contact. I am rather asocial in a way. And I don't know how to make up my mind between these two goals:

A) Stay in my country and pursue my career goal of working in higher education such as a university or college as a social worker. This feels like a safer and more comfortable option for me. More secure.

B) Move to the country of my dreams but most likely having to give up my social work career and work in a totally unrelated field. As a social worker speaking the native language is often a standard requirement and the country I would want to go to is Finland so yeah. I personally wouldn't mind that much doing another type of job. I like my career but by no means have any huge goals here that I really want to achieve.

In option A I would also buy property here which was my plan. But option B was/is my dream for the past decade, so I would also better keep saving my money and not buy property here.

,ESTJ,"I am an ESTJ and a sitcom lover. I watched Friends and New Girl before and I knew Schmidt and Monica are ESTJs. Today I was watching a New Girl episode and I realized that they have lots of things in common like cleaning, cooking and basically being the 'mom' of the group. But I also noticed that they both used to be fat from childhood to college (?). And it is shown that being fat is the reason for some of their typical ESTJ behavior (like control issues).

In fact, they have tertiary Ne. Just as the INFP can seem Si heavy or the IXTJs have very personal and noticeable Fi values motivating them, the ESTJ loves to play with ideas. In fact, most ESTJs I\'ve encountered are very open minded in that they\'re willing to entertain a reasonable argument so long as it has some application to their primary TeSi proclivity. Speaking of TeSi, because people misunderstand dominant and auxilary Si so severely, they tend to put too much emphasis on an unfair interpretation of it. Just as the ISTJ seeks an Si sense of concrete reality as understood through the Ti execution of Fi goals, the ESTJ seeks to execute (Te) their idea of what is good (Fi) using Si as their perceptive tool for doing so. To the ESTJ, enforcing Te structure is not limiting or evil because doing so ensures the most important and fundamental Fi ideals are upheld consistently. Just as the ISTJ seeks to prevent chaos that could disrupt Fi, the ESTJ seeks to reign in the chaos. The reason the ESTJ can seem so impersonal or harsh is because they have Fi inferior, so while they have a motivating sense of what is right, they often struggle to focus on individuality, despite wanting to help individuals. They support individually insofar as it doesn\'t break the bounds of their Te, but if you do break the structure of Te, you incurr their wrath because you might hurt the individual, as the TeSi structure exists to allow individuals to live the best lives possible within the confines necessary as dictated by the concrete realities of our world. (Sorry if that was a bit abstruse.) \n\nAs for the notion that the ESTJ is a less creative or visionary ENTJ, it fails to understand how SiNe works. SiNe exists to concretize and explore. In the ESTJ, concretization takes priority, but exploration and experimentation still constantly influence. Whereas the ENTJ sees the world for objective sensory reality and from that reality sets itself upon *the possibility*, the ESTJ sees many options and possibilities and concretizes as *true reality* those possibilities which conform to their subjective sense of reality. Whereas the ENTJ seeks to tame the chaos of the moment into a single vision, the ESTJ seeks to tame the chaos of many moments into a unified and structured moment. \n\nIn conclusion, though the ESTJ often seems like a harsh disciplinarian, usually this persona stems from a desire to force stability into reality, and the ESTJ sees themselves as fighting back the chaos that threatens to hurt a world of individuals. Since we all, according to TeFi, exist as indivuals and wish to continue doing so, we must all build and maintain the levies which hold back the ocean. Those who don\'t pull their weight or refuse to recognize the real-world consequences of complete focus on their personal values and identity endanger others\' ability to be individuals to the degree concrete reality permits. There are, unfortunately, facts of existence, and we can\'t ignore those facts in the face of idealism, lest our ability to find meaning in our own existences is washed to the untamed realm of chaos. \n\nThanks for reading, and stay tuned for the ENFP write-up!

I'm ended up very sure I'm an ENTJ, but not 100%, so I would love an opinion of some fellow ESTJ.

&amp;#x200B;

For most part of my life  I was a  kind of an introvert, spent long hours in front of a computer, either  playing video games, reading books, watching films or shows. I got kind  of fat, with shorsight and lost my hair. Then one day I finally hit the  fuck it and accepted that I wasn't happy with my life and that I have to  do something. Next day I went to the gym with some friends, shortly  after I shaved my head and got an eye surgery to correct my  short-shortsightedness.

It has  been like five years now, I haven't left the gym, I built the body I  wanted and more, although sometimes I drift for a week or two, but  always come back. But the important change was in my social life, those  who knew me back then almost don't believe the change, the antisocial  person that was all day in the computer no longer exists. I know almost  half the people in my community, when I go out I usually end up knowing  new people or making new ""friends""; sure some parties I still don't have  a good time in, but I figured it was because most people around here  dance a lot and I felt left out, but when I learn some salsa dancing I  started enjoying this parties more. I love nature and to travel and go  to new places, exploring, camping, hiking, found out I enjoy climbing  mountains, canopy and other sports that fill me with adrenaline. I could  go alone to those places, and sure I'll make friends along the way but  if I go with a lot of my people the better. When I get back of those  trips I feel amazing, wanting to repeat and often ended up being the one  planning the next one, some times even during the trip itself.

I  found that I like organizing things, either in writing or in my head. I  set down life goals, task and even habits. Had no problems setting  daily routines and sticking to them, for months or even years, maybe I'd  sleep one or two days down the road but I easily get back on track  unless there is a major force that stops me. Found pleasure in checking  out things off my To Do list, I was doing so when covid arrived, I  forcefully had to go back and live with my parents and those daily  habits and routines that I was building slowly fell apart, I lost my  motivation. And that is an important part I discovered, when I'm  motivated I am unstoppable, like I could only stop working on the task  or hobby in had for sleeping, eating and taking a bath. Motivation don't  last forever though, and when it dies I can finish the task with just  discipline and will power, or set aside, but never forgetting and  probably retaking and finishing that task in the future.

During  covid I got a managing position in front a group of volunteers in a  isolation center. In the past I would say no to those responsibilities,  but I was another person now and to my surprise not only did I gave it a  try but ended up exceeding and liking it. I found an unusual joy in  being in a position of power, is like I finally found something  demanding enough that made good use of all my abilities. I was good at  managing things, sure it was a challenge but that made me liked it even  more. I found that I had no problem treating people as assets and could  easily fire them, but I wouldn't do it so lightly as I was kind of  concerned of the perception of the rest of them of me as a leader and a  person, and most important I wanted to create a good environment where  every one were as happy as possible and peak at maximum efficiency. So I  sometimes tolerated a somewhat bad potato if it helped a greater cause,  or could dismiss another for the same cause. I also found that I have  no problem using people for my own benefits, although I kind of felt it  was wrong so I ended up giving something in return or trying to making  up to them, in my own mind since they probably didn't knew or understand  my ulterior motives. Is not like actually felt something rather than in  a conscious level I know that is in my best interest that since that's  person is helping me somehow is better if it gets something in return,  that way he/she can continue doing so even if he/she realizes.

During  those times I also ended up working under very stressful situations.  But I ended up discovering that I could work fine in those conditions,  sometimes even better, it was like the adrenaline helped me be even more  productive, sure I got stressed, intense and sometimes unbearable, but I  got the work done efficiently. Even those times when difficult  decisions were required, I had the cold blood to do the correct one,  based on was I thought it was correct and never afraid to standing up to  my beliefs, sometimes got into arguments with superiors, never  disrespectful but always courageous and fearless of saying what I think.

Recently  got a link form a friend to the 16P test, remembered I took it many  years ago and got INTJ. But I was a whole different person now, so  curiosity led me to repeat it: and I got ESTJ, I resonate with that  personality and thought it was a nice change, but I was still curious of  the change so I retook it in Spanish and got ENTJ and also felt like  that was the one.

,ESTJ,"Hi, y'all, just as it says in the title, I'm an adult child of a tough (in a good way) ESTJ mother. Just a few observations for discussion; in return, of course, you can ask me anything.

- ESTJ mom is very dedicated to her work and it's both endearing and maddening to me. I sense this dedication is because she both loves and feels she's needed to do it. Competency and efficiency are her love language wrt work and I love to let her vent when she has an obstacle and/or inefficient/incompetent co-worker, though I also want to tell her to sometimes delegate a bit more (even though I know she won't). Very ""if you want something done right you have to do it yourself""; first clue I had towards typing her.

- Great at talking about others' feelings in a pretty logical way. Her own, though? Not nearly so much, unless it's anger or frustration. The good news is that she seems to get better at strengthening her weak spot as she ages, and I wonder if this is typical in your experiences.

- Apologies happen rarely in verbal form unless as pleasantries or polite talk. I sometimes wonder if ESTJs ever apologize in other, perhaps more subtle, ways.

- Big mama bear energy; she's also very willing to help any way she can, usually through more concrete and material ways. She gets frustrated quickly when people don't ask straightforwardly for help, too; seems to be an ESTJ thing, from my research.",t2_1a5vt5gj,False,,0,False,INTP daughter with an ESTJ mom; observations/AMA,[],r/ESTJ,False,,,0,,False,t3_vuvqkn,False,light,0.92,,public,10,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion/Poll,False,10,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1657349148.0,text,,,,text,self.ESTJ,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, y&amp;#39;all, just as it says in the title, I&amp;#39;m an adult child of a tough (in a good way) ESTJ mother.

Upvote wise, it wasn\'t very popular (10+ on some subreddits, minus on some others). \n\nOver the years, I got 700 unique answers. Most of them came quickly, but I had fun noticing that throughout those (4?) years, some people kept finding this survey, mostly from google apparently.\n\nI\'m still looking for more answers, and perhaps I\'ll do yearly trends at some point, so if you haven\'t participated, please don\'t hesitate to do so!\n\n\\---\n\nNow let\'s get to the gist of it : the results.\n\n472 men, 246 women, and 15 non-binary answered the survey.\n\nAmong every gender, the preferences are as follow : \n\n1 - Underwear preferences\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iazfad85kj991.png?width=650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97372d21f411f4d395a832c840ff7aad61be5238\n\n  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ek752vdkj991.png?width=659&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d73d26e0a6afe39079dfb0ddc3e5c88825c73221\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ou4mo8qikj991.png?width=650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3654c66e1e9b86bc48eb46c68ce2ad0e12cd2b65\n\n2 - MBTI types\n\nThey might not represent Reddit userbase. Even though I posted in /r/MBTI aswell as every type subreddit, some upvoted more than others, which gave the survey more visibility within some communities moreso than others.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/upqs4z4zkj991.png?width=654&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dc77fff645a923508ec058a05aa7125bd248c2b\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zjlsqgi9mj991.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ac2c7e23f478c02e08cf6ac6de99b4abb3a7749\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/17cpcdxklj991.png?width=656&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29496c9b45cb9d073a89941d5c785654ba4833c8\n\n3 - Underwear preferences by MBTI, ordered by gender :\n\nFor this part, I didn\'t include the ""Other"" category, as it doesn\'t have enough results to be revelant. Please check the [imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/WgYSXvn), reddit wouldn\'t let me post more than 20 pictures on the initial thread\n\nNote : The ESFJ answers are women answers (although blue here) with a total count of 2 ESFJ answers. Not very revelant. ESFP has a low sample rate too\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGetting all this data in infographics somewhat easy to understand actually took me some time! If you have further questions I\'d be happy to answer, but I won\'t analyze the details much further.\n\nHope you enjoyed this uncommon survey!', 'author_fullname': 't2_2k98qagh', 'saved': False,

I went into more detail about the individual cognitive functions in my other notes, but I don't want to share them just as of yet as there are still a lot of sketchy ideas there that I haven't fully worked out all the way.

So, these are an overview of my notes so far. I'm sharing them because I want people to either tell me what they agree with or for people to highlight any holes in my research. Please, mention reasons to any of your points if you can, that would be really helpful!

## [Extroverted Thinking described by J.H. van der Hoop](https://mbtidatabase.tumblr.com/post/120030701986/extroverted-thinking-described-by-j-h-van-der)

📷 **absolutetypology**

The extravert of thinking type is guided by the structures and laws of thought, as these have been taught to him by his educator. He is able to make good use of these forms as arguments, and in his actions. Every sensuous experience is at once fitteed into its appropriate perceptual complex, and to a person of this type it would seem impossible that there could be awareness of the world apart from systematized conceptions. Facts are only thinkable for him as parts of an organized reality. Insight cannot even be regarded simply as intuitive experience, but must have its place in some systematic context. This way of thinking appears to the extraverted thinker as such a natural necessity that it is apt to be taken as absolute.  


The objectivity of knowledge finds here its main support in facts and authorities. The system according to which the extraverted thinker arranges his facts is also held to be objective, although it is accepted as based on the prevailing authoritative views, and is subjected to no critical examination from within.He orders his facts critically and with great care, and herein lies the strength of the individual of this type. On the other hand, his chosen system may be a weak point, since it is often accepted as unquestionable, without the person concerned being himself aware of this. In this ordering of ideas and judgements this fanger may be greater than where facts of sensory perception are concerned, because in the former case there are more likely to be all kinds of subjective and capricious elements in the material itself. There is no doubt that thought can do creative work in its establishment and classification of facts and judgements. In general, one may say, therefore, that this type possesses great receptivity for facts and opinions, but that the formulaes by which he tests these, and according to which he classifies them, are frequently somewhat rigid and limited. It depends also on circumstances, whether the rigid or the receptive side prevails in the development of the type.  


It is possible, even in children of this character, to observe these two sides. They are accessible to anything which their thoughts can classify, and are quick to adobt current systems and in being able to apply them. In addition, they also make use of their knowledge at an early age, so as themselves to be regarded as authorities, setting themselves up, wiht a certain pedantic precociousness, as superior to others. In later life, also, these peculiarities are found in alll kinds of variations in people of this type. Their knowledge usually embraces a wide field, and they are rarely unwilling to add something fresh to it. But there must e no interference with the system or with the principles to which they subscribe, and which for them possess absolute validity. Any such attempt is repulsed as foolish, morbid, or mischevious. Convinced of their objectivity, they strongly oppose anyone who would be prepared to consider the validity of other modes of classification or other principles. The advantages of their strong side, and the disadvantages of their weak points, are also frequently evident in another field. The official, doing useful work in all kinds of social conditions by the application of tiresome legal stipulations, may at home allow his rigid principles and his niggling exactitude to destroy all happiness. in his family, exerting an inhibiting influence on th edevelopment of his children. The advantage of a clear and business-like outlook may, when it is applied in petty ways, degenerate into a tiresome and dreary prosiness. Controlling principles and systems then become strait-jackets. Right and wrong, good and bad, are judged by this thinking type of person according to whether they conform to his system or not. this has for him absolute validity: it is the purest expression of the law of the universe. This is true for his scientific as for his ethical system. Anything that does not agree therewith appears to hima ccidental or untrue. He is convinced that such facts will, on closer examination, fit into his system, and that anything in his nature which he will ultimately br able to master.  


If the standpoint by such people is a broad minded one, they may exert a settling and purifying influence, both where it is a matter of profitting by experience and where controlling principles are involved.  


Among peoples of this type are found excellent officials, organizers, and scientists, people who distinguish themselves, both in practical and theoretical fields, by their thoroughness and their wide knowledge. Few women belong to this type. These people are always most effective in the external aspect of their sphere of influence, aince their adjustment is mainy in an outward direction. Here their aptness for system introducesa new clarity and vision. Where things are already in order, their efforts are limited to the maintenance of the status quo and to the resistance against disturbing influences. Hence in a narrower sphere they are liable to be somewhat conservative and conventional. In such circumstances they may appear to be quiet, pleasant people; but at the same time somewhat rigid and tyranntical, without much understanding of other’s needs.  


As far as activity is concerned, there is evident in these people a manifestation which we shall also have occasion to notice in intoverted thinkers and in feeling types, namely, the significant place assumed by the will. I agree with Jung in regarding to the will as an expression of consciously organizes aspirations. In thinking and feeling there is a definite extension of the conscious mental organization. As a result, instinctual and impulsive forces are canalized in the personality, increading the amount of free energy which is more or less constantly available. In instinctive and intuitive people, unconscious impulse and spontaneous inspiration play the most important part in stimulating activity. In people of thought and feeling, the will is the more constantly essential factor. The consequence is that, in general, thinking types manifest a constant, quiet activity. In addition to their feeling for order and their conscientiousness, their persistence is a particularly advantageous quality. Their contact with material things, and with theories and systems, is, however, usually better than it is with people. Their disinclination for introspection often prevents their entering very deeply into psychological problems. These reasoning people manifest, also, in general, a certain coldness and aloofness, their systematized thinking standing between themselves and the world. Even in extraverted thinkers this is noticeable in their attitude and approach, in spite of their satisfactory adaptation to circumstances.  


Both the instinctive and intuitive aspets of the disposition may assert themselves in thinking-types of this kind, and be subjected to the influence of reason. Reason tends to emphasize the sensory aspect of instinctual experience. Instinctual impulse belongs-as I shall show later- more to the life of feeling, and the thinker tries to keep away from this. He does this by representing it as inessential, and by concentrating his whole attention on more material experience. That part of his feeling-life which is affected by instinct, but does not disturb his principles, may them be allowed to add to his joy in life, in the form of “normal, healthy pleasures.” Even our intuitions may appear to us as universully valid knowledge in which case thought, too, is prepared to recognize their objective value; but only on condition that it is allowed to examine and delimit their validity. Extraverted thinking does this by comparing intuitively conceived views with one another. Even their own intuition is checked up in this way by people of this type. As regards to the intuition of others, one frequently finds in them a peculiar manifestation. If, for example, in a debate, another opinion is opposed to theirs, they will regard this too with great objectivity, simply placing the two judgements side by side, and thus giving the impression that they really have no opinion of their own. In reality, they think of all judgements as facts, so as to be able to include as many as they possibly can in the thought-system they are elaborating.  


The mental life of people of this kind is farthest removed from feeling, since this would disturb their liking for objectivity. Their feelings are, accordingly, the least independent part of them, and are equired to fall in entirely with their principles. Feelings which will not do this remain unconscious, but may well be obvious to others. While consciously they are governed only by principles, it will, for example, be obvious in a discussion that they are personally offended, from the irritable tone of their voice, or from an involuntary hostility to opponents. In such circumstances, also, they may occasionally, in pursuit of their aims, employ means which could not well be reconciled with their principles. In general, they keep matters of feeling at a distance, particularly where love and sex are concerned.”  


I also want to add that this was written well before the Myers briggs system was developed, so the information will not coincide perfectly with TJ types.

Extraverted Thinking Types

* Ideas are situational and dependent upon rules of the moment
* Likes to compare all facts and opinions to see which one is correct for all to follow
* \[ Inferior Fi \] - May come across as cold, self-righteous, hypocritical and irritable but deny any feeling is there at all
* \[ Inferior Fi \] - In romance, may be uncomfortable with expressing feelings or emotions but show love through actions
* Te ideas can either be universal philosophical laws or practical ideas put in place to help the situation run smoothly for all
* Can be heroic and concerned with getting justice",t2_fcoezkzs,False,,0,False,extroverted thinking,[],r/ESTJ,False,,,0,,False,t3_umwmq6,False,light,0.83,,public,4,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Fun!,False,4,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1652227661.0,text,,,,text,self.ESTJ,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=""https://mbtidatabase.tumblr.com/post/120030701986/extroverted-thinking-described-by-j-h-van-der""&gt;Extroverted Thinking described by J.H. van der Hoop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷 &lt;strong&gt;absolutetypology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extravert of thinking type is guided by the structures and laws of thought, as these have been taught to him by his educator. He is able to make good use of these forms as arguments, and in his actions. Every sensuous experience is at once fitteed into its appropriate perceptual complex, and to a person of this type it would seem impossible that there could be awareness of the world apart from systematized conceptions. Facts are only thinkable for him as parts of an organized reality. Insight cannot even be regarded simply as intuitive experience, but must have its place in some systematic context. This way of thinking appears to the extraverted thinker as such a natural necessity that it is apt to be taken as absolute.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objectivity of knowledge finds here its main support in facts and authorities. The system according to which the extraverted thinker arranges his facts is also held to be objective, although it is accepted as based on the prevailing authoritative views, and is subjected to no critical examination from within.He orders his facts critically and with great care, and herein lies the strength of the individual of this type. On the other hand, his chosen system may be a weak point, since it is often accepted as unquestionable, without the person concerned being himself aware of this. In this ordering of ideas and judgements this fanger may be greater than where facts of sensory perception are concerned, because in the former case there are more likely to be all kinds of subjective and capricious elements in the material itself. There is no doubt that thought can do creative work in its establishment and classification of facts and judgements. In general, one may say, therefore, that this type possesses great receptivity for facts and opinions, but that the formulaes by which he tests these, and according to which he classifies them, are frequently somewhat rigid and limited. It depends also on circumstances, whether the rigid or the receptive side prevails in the development of the type.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible, even in children of this character, to observe these two sides. They are accessible to anything which their thoughts can classify, and are quick to adobt current systems and in being able to apply them. In addition, they also make use of their knowledge at an early age, so as themselves to be regarded as authorities, setting themselves up, wiht a certain pedantic precociousness, as superior to others. In later life, also, these peculiarities are found in alll kinds of variations in people of this type. Their knowledge usually embraces a wide field, and they are rarely unwilling to add something fresh to it. But there must e no interference with the system or with the principles to which they subscribe, and which for them possess absolute validity. Any such attempt is repulsed as foolish, morbid, or mischevious. Convinced of their objectivity, they strongly oppose anyone who would be prepared to consider the validity of other modes of classification or other principles. The advantages of their strong side, and the disadvantages of their weak points, are also frequently evident in another field. The official, doing useful work in all kinds of social conditions by the application of tiresome legal stipulations, may at home allow his rigid principles and his niggling exactitude to destroy all happiness. in his family, exerting an inhibiting influence on th edevelopment of his children. The advantage of a clear and business-like outlook may, when it is applied in petty ways, degenerate into a tiresome and dreary prosiness. Controlling principles and systems then become strait-jackets. Right and wrong, good and bad, are judged by this thinking type of person according to whether they conform to his system or not. this has for him absolute validity: it is the purest expression of the law of the universe. This is true for his scientific as for his ethical system. Anything that does not agree therewith appears to hima ccidental or untrue. He is convinced that such facts will, on closer examination, fit into his system, and that anything in his nature which he will ultimately br able to master.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the standpoint by such people is a broad minded one, they may exert a settling and purifying influence, both where it is a matter of profitting by experience and where controlling principles are involved.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among peoples of this type are found excellent officials, organizers, and scientists, people who distinguish themselves, both in practical and theoretical fields, by their thoroughness and their wide knowledge. Few women belong to this type. These people are always most effective in the external aspect of their sphere of influence, aince their adjustment is mainy in an outward direction. Here their aptness for system introducesa new clarity and vision. Where things are already in order, their efforts are limited to the maintenance of the status quo and to the resistance against disturbing influences. Hence in a narrower sphere they are liable to be somewhat conservative and conventional. In such circumstances they may appear to be quiet, pleasant people; but at the same time somewhat rigid and tyranntical, without much understanding of other’s needs.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as activity is concerned, there is evident in these people a manifestation which we shall also have occasion to notice in intoverted thinkers and in feeling types, namely, the significant place assumed by the will. I agree with Jung in regarding to the will as an expression of consciously organizes aspirations. In thinking and feeling there is a definite extension of the conscious mental organization. As a result, instinctual and impulsive forces are canalized in the personality, increading the amount of free energy which is more or less constantly available. In instinctive and intuitive people, unconscious impulse and spontaneous inspiration play the most important part in stimulating activity. In people of thought and feeling, the will is the more constantly essential factor. The consequence is that, in general, thinking types manifest a constant, quiet activity. In addition to their feeling for order and their conscientiousness, their persistence is a particularly advantageous quality. Their contact with material things, and with theories and systems, is, however, usually better than it is with people. Their disinclination for introspection often prevents their entering very deeply into psychological problems. These reasoning people manifest, also, in general, a certain coldness and aloofness, their systematized thinking standing between themselves and the world. Even in extraverted thinkers this is noticeable in their attitude and approach, in spite of their satisfactory adaptation to circumstances.  &lt;/p&gt;

#  (ESTj) Subtypes

## -[Te](https://www.sociotype.com/socionics/information_elements/Te): The [ESTj](https://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/LSE-ESTj/) Logical Subtype

### The logical subtype is efficient, correct, dry in dialogue, has a strict appearance and is unapproachable. They’re serious and restrained, not inclined to jokes. Usually laconic, but when angry, are difficult to calm down. Are direct in their behaviour and conversation, their sharpness in judgment often leads to ethical dilemmas. Prone also to other extreme measures of emotional expression: i.e. they will keep silent in order to avoid dialogue and compile insults for use at a later time. Uncompromising and stubborn. Sometimes try to gain the interlocutor’s intimacy through heart-felt intonations in voice, Often a mistrustful hypochondriac; they do not enjoy speaking of feelings. Prefer to remain engaged in something useful until it is completed. Are constantly strained(intense) and it is difficult for them to relax; are subject to unexpected fits of anger.

### Attempts to combine the entire cycle of production in their hands. A good worker, does not tolerate incompetence, is well educated in their area of competence. Very operational, sometimes wear themselves out with work. Consider that only thus can they require the same from others. Can be sharp in judgments. Usually formulates tasks very clearly. In the sphere of production attains the responsibility for a product, love to admire what they have made, and emphasize the advantage of their goods. Works well under the conditions of a stable market - in transportation, in the army. Clothing is conservative; for them, the main things are cleanliness, order and functionality.

### Sexual behavior

Disdains uncertainty, coquetry, verbal expressions of feelings and frivolous behavior. Place matters above emotions and capably demonstrates coldness; therefore needs a patient, self-possessed partner, someone reasonable, kind, economic, industrious, and loving of humankind.

## [Si](https://www.sociotype.com/socionics/information_elements/Si): The [ESTj](https://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/LSE-ESTj/) Sensory Subtype

### The sensory subtype is characterized by a differentiation between their internal stability and working capacity. Internally unstable, they are likewise extremely vigorous and cannot relax without business affairs as they do not like wasting time in vain. Interested in new technologies within the professional sphere and able to adapt these to serve their needs. Possess a sense of humor. Their speech is abrupt and emotional; their smile is somewhat tense. Pulls together distance in dialogue through hospitable, friendly gestures – embraces and light touches. Briskly conducts conversation and/or jokes. An aesthete with a taste for gourmet, they love original dishes and beautiful, expensive objects of quality. Are able to relieve pressures by sitting at a table with friends but rarely allow themselves the rest to themselves that they need. Have a tendency to corpulence, their movements are gusty, sharp, quick and impulsive; often embody a restless demeanor.

### Feels at home in the intermediate fields of production – in trade or management. Is less inquisitive than the logical subtype; Is very sociable, emotional, gregarious. Frequently hospitable; loves comfort and cosiness, and likes to spend leisure time in nature. Easily manages the responsibilities of a technical director or manager.

### Sexual behavior

Internally sentimental but speak about feelings in witty/joking form. Touchy, jealous and distrustful, are prone to exaggerations; emotional and energetic. Erotically are initiative taking and sexual. Greatly value pleasant sensations of any kind: tasty food, comfort, convenience, aesthetics, good manners; show diplomacy in their social interaction. They value friendship and love and are always prepared to help when needed. Require a moderately coquettish, romantic partner, whom willingly responds to their erotic initiatives; someone modest, reliable, restrained and emotionally diverse.

,ESTJ,"I'm am ESTJ myself and it appears we are usually at the top of the list of most hated MBTI types. The reasons they usually cite are: 1)being bossy and 2)intolerance for others being different. Usually say things like we're the quintessential bully. I think some of those things can be done by other types who often get mistyped as us. I myself don't tell anyone what to do unless a) it's my job to do so or b)their behavior is negatively impacting me in some way. 

&amp;nbsp;


For example, I only tell someone what to do if I'm their assigned supervisor. Because, hello, that's my job. Making sure people come in on time and do their job correctly. I believe people have to EARN their right to be in management and tell others what to do. You can't just walk into an office and everyone has to do what you say because you scream the loudest. Telling everyone within earshot what to do is more typical ENTJ behavior. They sometimes don't respect hiearchy/rank due to their NI and this can sometimes cause them to self-appoint themselves as everyone's boss. They are called ""The Commander"" after all. People think ""oh that annoying guy who tries to tell everyone what to do in the office? T-hat must be an ESTJ! Since they are 'the manager' on mbti"". My response is ""yes, we are the managers--but only if it's our job"". We usually have a reason and don't usually do it for the sake of bossing you around as ""being bossy"" is defined. 


&amp;nbsp;


Moving on to that guy that picks on people for being different. You know the one that likes to make fun of people's weight , appearance or odd hairdo. Again everyone thinks that's us. This form of bullying is often done for the rush or just ""the lolz"" which is something we rarely, if ever do. The person that's usually doing that is an ESTP. They like to crack the jokes to try to get a laugh out of the office or class.  Sometimes they will get physical and try to start fights which is again for the rush and excitement from their SE dom. This is not ESTJ behavior. "" Oh I see you have an odd hairdo, we should totally fight about it"" Sounds silly and asinine to the typical ESTJ. 

&amp;nbsp;


I know to a certain extent that I didn't mistype these behaviors. We took an MBTI test in my office a few years back which is how I found out about it. The two that typed ENTJ had exactly this behavior and both were fired for exactly the reason of trying to tell everyone what to do when it wasn't their job. The biggest assholes in my high school were ones that mocked others and found random people they can get a kick out of bullying. I followed up with one searched him online and as an adult he does drugs, sells drugs, and assaults people and is in and out of jail. Nothing about him screams ESTJ or ""I follow or enforce the rules"" lol. All consequences of his SE dom. The other appears to have gotten his act together more and works in sales(very common ESTP career choice) but he still makes fun of people on FB just for fun, cons others, and has been to jail a few times for it. 


&amp;nbsp;

In conclusion, I'm not saying our type never exhibits these behaviors or those other types are ALWAYS like that. So if anyone want to form a strawman argument where I said that, go ahead and keep beating on that strawman lol. I'm just saying some things often get lumped into us which we sometimes aren't. ESTJs seem to get all the heat when it should be more evenly distributed. 


&amp;nbsp;


To prove I'm not being completely biased, I begurdgingly admit, we are most likely to be the asshole boss and the asshole cop. ""Follow the rules damn it!"" comes to mind. However, the title of the office asshole (who isn't your boss) and the schoolyard bully most often belongs to ENTJ and ESTP respectivelly.

2) I grew up in a very XXTJ oriented family and therefore appreciate and admire a lot of the qualities that Te doms have, even though I’m am very much an  Ne Fi dom. As a result I’m comfortable and very much enjoy hanging out with people like him and have a good handle on the Te Si situation. (My weaknesses, his strengths) 

2) I haven’t communicated how I feel (that’s on me) in big part because sorting out my conflicted feelings has been difficult, and because I want to present them in a direct and concise way that I know he will appreciate. 

3) We both are people who will make things work, but I he already has a plan for what his life will look like in the future, and I don’t. I’m realizing I’m still figuring things out. 

4) I truly love him and know he loves me too, but while I feel like I can meet him in the middle and appreciate his TeSi, I don’t think he appreciates my NeFi to the same extent. This makes it difficult internally for me because I feel like staying with him longer (while fun, stable, and prosperous) would mean denying my NeFi side more than I could bear. I would be restless longterm with him. 


5) We are compatible on pretty much everything else, but that compatibility, I feel, is due to me holding back to make it work more than I should. 


How do I communicate this to him. Any tips?

,ESTJ,"So my gf did the personality test and she ended up being estj but i have some doubts. I’ll point out why:
1)I am an infj so we shouldn’t have a great feeling but we actually do, we sometimes fight because we have a very different thinking process, but in the end we understand each other, we know open communication is key in our relationship. 
2) she is not tidy at all, you could see her studying on her desk with her elbows up on piles of book while trying to write on a sheet of paper. She is so on point when it comes to organize a plan to achieve a goal, meaning she has an organized mind, but she isn’t tidy.
3) she loves adventures and would kill herself if she had an ordinary routine with no space to try new things, she is very curious about things she doesn’t know (though sometimes she puts things in the “bullshit” folder even if she doesn’t know much about that topic)
4) she is emphatic, she says that it’s easy for her to know what goes on in my mind, and i agree, she gets me a lot even when i am guided by feelings and there’s no logic in what i am thinking or saying.

I guess she might look estj to other people but when we are alone she seems a different person. I would say she develops this “shield” that looks like estj when she is afraid to show her truly self.

,ESTJ,"Whom should I ask for advice if not fellow Te doms? 

Since I started taking sertraline, my life quality has improved but it is still far from perfect. There is a couple of things I would like to achieve in my life. Unfortunately, they diverge in time. It is hard to focus on one task when new ideas come to my mind and I want to accomplish all of the goals I have set. It is hard to choose just one thing or set priorities. Making plans, schedules and all help only temporarily. I lose motivation when something doesn't go according to the plan or the results aren't satisfying.

&lt;p&gt;Since I started taking sertraline, my life quality has improved but it is still far from perfect. There is a couple of things I would like to achieve in my life. Unfortunately, they diverge in time. It is hard to focus on one task when new ideas come to my mind and I want to accomplish all of the goals I have set. It is hard to choose just one thing or set priorities. Making plans, schedules and all help only temporarily. I lose motivation when something doesn&amp;#39;t go according to the plan or the results aren&amp;#39;t satisfying. I need to see constant progress to keep moving forward and know exactly what to do to start working.

,ESTJ,"One year difference. I started working as a teacher exactly a year ago. I haven't taken the test in such a long time due to simply not being interested in anything other than work, money and getting things done my way. I have become more organised, disciplined and responsible during that time as well, as opposed to a year ago when I used to jump from task to task, from job to job and never finding the perfect place for myself nor how to run my life. Until now.

Last time I had taken the test, I got ESTP, which is the same personality type as my partner, yet it seemed hard to believe, as we're so different from one another, especially in current times.

He's as extroverted as I am, however he doesn't enjoy schedules, isn't as strict with his work, nor has any plans, and isn't keen on order, which is one thing we often have arguments about.

There's nothing greater than taking the role of a leader, an educator, and earning the praise and respect that you deserve for your work.

True, it's a lot of pressure, but it's most certainly worth it.

So today, right after work and after having everything that needed to be done checked out from my list, I had found myself with nothing left to do. I've cleared my tasks, done all lesson plans, cleaned the house and made meals in advance. Now, how do I relax? I could waste time on the internet, as most people my age do, so I did just that. I took the test again out of boredom and got the result. ESTJ. It all makes sense now.

Never in my life had I ever thought that a job could change a person so drastically, but it has.

Her result was being an ESTJ! 
I‘ve readed on [quora](https://imgur.com/a/UHFDeUQ) how the ESTJ adored his adopted ENTP daughter very much but sometimes get very frustrated on how free they like to be and honestly I have seen myself in this. 
I‘m also adopted and the ESTJ woman choosed the ENTP child out of other 5 children. But growing up it‘s been kinda hard for me to talk to her about feelings and sometimes it can get a bit cold. 
Also I think we all know ENTPs love to explore and become independent, while the ESTJs likes controlling. So I became somewhat spoiled since she liked to do everything for me and whenever I wanted to do something I had to explain every detail. Feeling like a mental checklist she does on me to decide if I can do or not. (I have started visiting  other cities in my country when I became 20). 
Whenever I wanted a hug or just some love, she just assumed something was wrong. 
She wants to know lots about me and my life, but I‘m not very fond of it because I just dont want to get judged by her. On the other hand, she‘s not very open about her life which makes it extra difficult.

,ESTJ,"Hey guys/girls, INFP here, I'm looking for advices because I've recently met a wonderful ESTJ (with very developed intuition, he almost seems like an ENTJ at times) and I'm unsure on how to proceed from now on.

For context : we've worked together on a school project just the two of us for an entire week, the communication and cooperation was very fluid and effortless - we were a good team to his own allegations and he complimented me a LOT (to me directly and to others). On my part I find him really awesome and I trust him and look up to him a lot.

Now our training has been over for more than a week and if I don't make some overtures towards him, we will not probably not see each other again, having no friends in common, nor any other casual reason to hang out together. Generally, he seems to be really proficient at casual pleasantries with people (he is more polite than I am), but much more hesitant when it comes to actually delving into a friendship.

(Which I don't fault him for, I do suppose it's not easy with low Fi). But - the thing is I was the one to ask him to work on the project with me, and if I have to initiate again, I'm going to be feeling like I'm harassing/inconveniencing him a bit. I also have no idea on how to smoothly re-approach him, considering all of our convos so far has been revolving around work activities and there's no possibility  in our sector to just launch another group project out of the blue.

Another very important piece of context that I should mention is : he is married which he emphasized himself in passing several times, leading me to think he was trying to nip in the bud every false idea I could have. I have no intention at all of messing with his marriage which from little info I have seem to be a completely happy one, and thus I didn't flirt with him, but it's also undeniable that a few times the connection between the two of us was a bit out of the ordinary.

So my questions to you guys would be :

\- in a similar situation, would you want the relationship to continue (under any form, friendship, working together, etc.) or would you just find it quick to move on and not think much of it afterwards ? Would you just consider the other person as a valuable asset for teamwork and little else ?

\- would you be wary to try to form a friendship with someone of the opposite sex with whom you've clicked so well if you are married ?

\- Do you generally expect the more feely person to take the initiative when it comes to try to get to the movies together or grab a beer together or to hang out together ?

,ESTJ,"Hello, r/ESTJ! 

I'm gathering information on the correlation between MBTI, enneagram (core, wing, tritype, &amp; instinctual variants) and 4 temperaments. 

**[Survey link: https://forms.gle/SpDsdHfnT7k7cKyL7](https://forms.gle/SpDsdHfnT7k7cKyL7)** 

You only need to know your MBTI type to complete the survey. As you're on the ESTJ sub, I assume you're fairly confident in your type. Everything else is optional. 

I will publish the ESTJ results here, in probably a few weeks. I'll be posting the more general results on r/mbti at the same time. I've also made a hypothesis of what correlations I predict, which I will link in the comments.

,ESTJ,"First off I want to say that my best best friend is an ESTJ and she’s AMAZING!!! She is so smart and capable. Super confident and really, really loving, generous and sweet 🥰 (But no one knows that because she comes off as such a hardass.)

If she was suddenly elected mayor of a blighted city she’d have it turned into America’s last hometown in a month. She is simply the best.

At work though I work with an ESTJ, Marcus. We are just like oil and water. He’s arrogant, rude, and bossy.

For example, I’ll be in the middle of a task and he’ll come and take the tools out of my hands and sort of body check me out of the way. Or he’ll come up to coworkers and I talking and suddenly start talking over us about Pokémon or DND, which none of us care about.

I dread working with him and live to annoy him.

The thing is though, he’s this young intelligent guy with a lot of potential. Like super gifted. Great work ethic, he might even have a photographic memory. Marcus has a lot of talents and is actually quite accomplished.

He mentioned becoming a bar back the other day because he’d like to learn a trade like bar tending. I’m probably worried about nothing, but I just think he could do something more.

I’ve tried steering him into union building trades. He’d be put in charge of jobs quickly and could easily make it into a management position. 

I suggested that he become a surveyor. That is an in demand job, pays a lot and is interesting. 

But what else would be a good career for him? What do you guys do and what do you enjoy?

...and I wish a less catchy title would do it. But quite frankly, capitalizing the insanity is about the only way to make it really clear from my POV.

* I don't know who I am, usually. This sounds stupid, but it makes sense because I'm detached from my emotional ""core"" most of the times. I did try to deliberately feel it more consciously, but it led me to really weird strings of thoughts along with a _few_ insights that tell me what I really want (last time, it was a Netflix abo and deleting my YouTube channel). And because I am unaware of my true cravings, I am incapable of breaking out of my loop of habit.


* I don't see the sense in Fi unless it's too late. And especially the last point is important. I only feel the consequences, not the warnings: I feel lonely because I cannot connect with anyone about my true feelings, I scared off someone that really meant something to me and it's still bugging me, I get called out for being rude or unfriendly by people who didn't deserve it from my POV. 


* At the same time, I tend to condone Fi. For accusing others for not complying to what it wants, for its tendency to twist facts, and for its ""disgusting"" sensitivity (I'm putting ""disgusting"" in quotation marks because it's not a statement of fact but my erroneous personal feeling about it). 

I am inclined to say that I hate it. But I also know that there is no use in suppressing it, either. It's just that I cannot cope with it and once I'm having too much, I tend to mentally and physically collapse from it.

The worst thing, however, is that I don't even know what to do. I am conflicted about the way to approach conflicts because my Te approach of just tackling the issue in some way is hijacked by Fi's interference (have you kept in mind that this is _right_?).

Ok, I am a \[F 20 ESTJ\] college student nearing the end of my time in my undergraduate degree. I finally met this guy in person that I have kind of been eyeing for a few years through snapchat stories etc. He is the epitome of a confident extrovert and apparently we have had on and off random conversations throughout the years since we've had each other on Snap.

I finally got the nerve and asked him out on a date last week to a hockey game, keeping my expectations low considering he always seemed to be out drinking and w a lot of the ""fratty looking guys"" that go to my uni. It went SO well. We were never struggling to keep the conversation flowing, and the gaps in speaking felt comfortable and as far from awkward as could be possible. The first night progressed and we ended up grabbing a late dinner at a bar and then I went over to finally meet his kitten I had been commenting on for the last few months.

He was SO respectful and totally surprised me with the intelligent comments and level-headed worldview that showed through the stories he'd tell throughout conversation. We seemed to share a lot of the same values and morals and see eye to eye on things like surface level politics etc (which are surprisingly pretty important for me and my friendships it seems).

Since then, we've hung out another time for a chill trash reality TV show + wine date and he finally kissed me. 10/10. Conversation continued to impress me and we talked about politics, theories about the world and consciousness and a bunch of other topics that I'd say most college students wouldn't be super interested in discussing with their new romantic interests.

I asked him his personality type on the second date because I am annoying and love collecting as much data on the guys that I am interested in so that I can try to best pick their brains and better micro-analyze all the decisions that they make when it comes to my own interactions with them.

He's an ENTJ. I don't think I have ever dated an ENTJ before but now I'm convinced that this is the ideal ESTJ pairing.

Ok, to cut to the chase, are there any ESTJs here that have dated ENTJs or vice versa and what were the issues with your personalities colliding? What could you see as a potential red flag for this pairing? What should I look out for in myself and in him in this developing relationship? etc.

,ESTJ,"Hi guys!

I'm having some problems dealing with my father, who happens to be an ESTJ. He's not a very healthy person from a psychological point of view, he's quite aggressive in communication, doesn't easily accept new ways of make use of things and time, isn't always able to treat other in a respectful manner and doesn't really control his emotions and anger (these traits obviously have nothing to do with being ESTJs or not). Anyway, I have always respected his opinion because even though he was saying it the ""wrong way"", he has always been reasonable and most of the time he was right about things. I don't know what's happening now, if it's him becoming old or what, but he is becoming quite close minded (which he wasn't, he was still fine hearing things out before making a judgement, now he is a lot more sensitive) and now that his kids are becoming adults he doesn't seem to be confortable when someone exposes the bullshit he tells himself. He is still aggressive when communicating, but now he is wrong about most things, he seems to lack the rational and neutral perspective he had and people are just sick of it so they give him negative feedback. And he's clearly taking it as a personal attack, even if it is for his own wellbeing or because we're worried for him. He deals with it as if it was just a critic without a reason, but there are reasons and he just doesn't want to listen.  
I hope to get some insight from you.  
Are there any ways that you're sure would make YOU want to listen to somebody?  
What are some traits in a person or in a communication style that you would take damn seriously?  
What is necessary to make you question your opinions?  
I really would like him to understand other points of view and make better choices, please don't take this as a way to control him but maybe I am missing something so I'm asking for your thoughts",t2_3yekagzx,False,,0,False,How to make myself heard by an ESTJ father,[],r/ESTJ,False,,,0,,False,t3_sa4p4q,False,light,0.83,,public,4,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Relationships,False,4,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1642864824.0,text,,,,text,self.ESTJ,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys!&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;quot;Of course we followed the correct procedure, since we got the right answer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

,ESTJ,"Yo, what's up ESTJs? This is my first post here, so I just gotta say; you guys are really cool.

Because I like your type so much, I've decided to try and roleplay as one in a D&amp;D campaign. After creating all of his backstory and personality, I realised that he'd make a convincing ESTJ.

Only problem is, the type functions very differently to how I do.

I've been giving the character a whirl over the past few weeks, and he's much more difficult for me to roleplay than I thought he would be. I really enjoy the challenge of playing him, especially since I think his personality is so interesting when mixed in with the other characters (who are a bit chaotic and in need of organising).

I'm an ENTP, if that makes it any easier to envision what the problem might be.

I think specifically what I'm having trouble with his Te. At the moment I think I'm flickering too much into my Ne. I'm just not super sure how to express Te in-character. Maybe I've not researched enough? I guess you could consider digging around here some kind of research?

So I was just wondering if there was anybody with sage advice that could aid me a little. I'm open to any ideas. I want to do you guys good justice, and not fall into weird stereotypes. I'd like to be realistic and nuanced if I can be.

&lt;p&gt;Only problem is, the type functions very differently to how I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been giving the character a whirl over the past few weeks, and he&amp;#39;s much more difficult for me to roleplay than I thought he would be. I really enjoy the challenge of playing him, especially since I think his personality is so interesting when mixed in with the other characters (who are a bit chaotic and in need of organising).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m an ENTP, if that makes it any easier to envision what the problem might be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think specifically what I&amp;#39;m having trouble with his Te. At the moment I think I&amp;#39;m flickering too much into my Ne. I&amp;#39;m just not super sure how to express Te in-character. Maybe I&amp;#39;ve not researched enough? I guess you could consider digging around here some kind of research?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was just wondering if there was anybody with sage advice that could aid me a little. I&amp;#39;m open to any ideas. I want to do you guys good justice, and not fall into weird stereotypes. I&amp;#39;d like to be realistic and nuanced if I can be. I just don&amp;#39;t know how to go about playing a character whose lifestyle and decisions may be completely different to mine IRL.&lt;/p&gt;

,ESTJ,"Hello! Glad to see y'all got your old sub back!   


I have a question, and I've been trying all over to find a decent solid answer. But I've been trying to nail down whether I'm ESFJ or ESTJ. I really dislike the tests, because I feel like a lot of them were written by a very abstract person, and particularly hate the sliding scale ones, because am I 38%? 45%? I don't know.  


Regardless. I tested as both ESFJ and ESTJ. My sister is convinced that I'm a T, because she's an uber-F who likes to watch sappy movies *specifically so she can cry*, because ""crying is cathartic"". However, I don't agree with her conclusion that I'm cold/unfeeling, because I absolutely do have certain scenes/scenarios in movies that will make me cry.   


But combing through the MBTI sub sort of leaves one with the impression that ESFJs are vapid party freaks, and that ESTJs are cold-hearted taskmasters. Obviously neither of those is accurate. But nevertheless, seeing a great many descriptions (even on typing websites) of the ESTJ being cold, I concluded that logically, I must be ESFJ.  


Then I shared a screenshot of the spreadsheet I create every time we consider moving somewhere. And an acquaintance I have, commented that it was the most ESTJ thing he'd ever seen in his life... maybe even ISTJ. He then asked if I've ever been though to be an ISTJ (I have had this argued as well... plus my husband constantly says I'm the old guy from Gran Torino, apparently he is?), or ENTJ (I'm relatively certain no one has mistaken me for ENTJ, plus I don't abstract.)  


So now I have another wrench thrown in. And again, my family... absolutely no help. My mother says I cannot possibly be an I, because I leave my house *voluntarily*. My sister says I cannot possibly be an F, because I'm too blunt, and I've hurt her feelings many times. Which is true, but never on purpose. I say things, then I realize I hurt someone, then I feel awful.

He acknowledged that I'd said I was quite shy and he let me choose the location/activity from a list of options he provided (I believe for my comfort). We agreed to a walk along the river (scenic route) and I let him know he could bring his dog (which he did). There was never any indication as to whether this was just a friendly hang or a date/predate.

At the very end, he gave me a quick hug and said that we'd have to get together again and mentioned that he'd be back in the area in 2-3 weeks for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. This was all said quite quickly and as he turned and walked to his car he called back ""talk soon.""

,ESTJ,"Hello~ 

So I wanted an opinion because I’m very fascinated in mbti and everything and thought asking this here would make the most sense. 

I’ve been seeing this ESTJ guy for 2 months and change now, and we communicate via a messaging app in Korea, throughout the day. He messages me “good morning” and will ask me if slept well/got to work okay/ate well/ etc and I’m just unsure of what to make of this dynamic. 

I was sick and he bought me premium tangerines and shipped them to my house during our conversation which was thoughtful. 

The first time we met, we had really passionate and great sex. If I wrote a book about it, it would be a top seller for sure. Anyways, after our first meeting, our schedules became so complicated and we couldn’t see each other until 6 weeks later. When we saw eachother the 2nd time, he saw me (drove 1 hour there and back for a quickie and chat about 40mins~) during his overtime and went back to work. 

He went on a boys trip with his friends and he updated me about everything that he did throughout his trip and sent pictures all day long to me which I thought was cute.

1. refusal to try and see things from another's perspective.
2. the almost glee at trying to scold someone for their circumstance instead of even trying to understand how they got into that situation (before you apply what could be blame or fix or whatever)
3. dismissing something as ""nonsense"" when you know you don't even understand it (to know if it is nonsense or not)
4. when you do something bad to someone else, it's a ""non issue"" but when someone does something to you, you dwell.. so much so you bring it up years later... and keep bringing it up

,ESTJ,"FYI:I am not a native speaker.If my English was bad in some parts of this post,I would like to apologize.

Hello everyone.I have a friend whom I think might be an ESTJ.We have recently started talking about some random things at school.But today we have agreed to talk on what I think of him as a person.To be honest most of the talks we have are small talks which don't really reveal to me much about him and so I don't really have a clue.Therefore I would appreciate some insights from actual ESTJs and not sources online.

Here's some reasonings for why I think he is an ESTJ:
Te:He's a surface level thinker.I know it sounds bad but what I am trying to say is that when he thinks he considers many options at once.The downside is that he doesn't really reach a deep level of understanding.For example,he knows a lot of people but when I ask him about them,he can tell me several facts without really having a grasp of their personality.Also he recently asked me what I think of some classmates in my class.I told him that I don't really know them and I need some time to analyze and have a lot of deep and meaningful conversations with them.He said that it's not necessary and he can tell what someone is like just from a conversation.

Si:He shows a preference for old ways and knowledge.He has just got back into a game after several years of not playing so his playstyle is pretty old-fashioned.Everyone is just yelling at him,trying to make him relearn how to play the game but his old playstyle is still somewhat working for him so he refuses to.Additionally,he has a lot of respect for social structures and he does step up to take charge when my class is disorganized and feels directionless.He has been teaming up with other people to organize events for my class.

Ne:He can listen to others and accept new perspectives.He can be quite stubborn at times but it's tolerable.

Fi:I don't know if I should bring this up but he has had a crush on a girl for two years and does nothing about it.I am not sure if he doesn't do anything because he can not understand his emotions or it's because he does not know what he wants to do but regardless he seems to struggle immensely with his own emotions and he has reached out to me for help.But this could be because he's young and inexperienced.

Lastly,I can be dead wrong but I have already told him that I am not confident about this and he said he doesn't care.Anyhow that's all.",t2_dvdbjgs9,False,,0,False,I need some insights on this type,[],r/ESTJ,False,,,0,,False,t3_179tfqa,False,light,0.75,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question/Advice,False,2,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1697530746.0,text,,,,text,self.ESTJ,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;FYI:I am not a native speaker.If my English was bad in some parts of this post,I would like to apologize.&lt;/p&gt;

My dad is an ESTJ and he has been spending A LOT of time alone lately - like hours on social media apps and YouTube.

I personally feel uncomfortable with the amount of time he is spending on there and not with his family. Do you fellow ESTJs do this too?

,ESTJ,"      My gf and I have been smoothly dating for well over seven months and it actually hasn’t been going badly. Specifically, it’s going a little bit better than I expect most teengage relationships to go at any rate. I’m just trying to figure out if what we have is genuine. From what I understand, ENTJs and ESTJs are meant to spend their whole time butting heads instead of progressing. Of course I’m not going to base my whole relationship on four letters, but Myers-Briggs has been able to predict enough that I am absolutely willing to hear any thoughts or testimonies that you have.

      I am seriously approaching full certainty of her being an ESTJ. As for me, it is possible I was mistyped, but so far neither this:

I work for a large corporation. I learned about a new program that I wanted to onboard while at an out of town Conference this weekend. I was REALLY EXCITED about it. I remember telling the outside vendors...I will *definitely* make this happen! Fast forward to today I finally get to see my ENTJ Director who's been out of reach at meetings the last two days and leaving for a two week international vacation tomorrow (wanted to get things rolling before she left). I wanted to do this at the office vs email because I knew I would be more effective in person. I also talked to another director (INTJ) who's tech -savvy and I get them both on board (I knew I would be successful). I love working with other Doers.

I am *totally* in a groove. I knew that there would be some legal permissions to overcome. I try to download said legal addendum, but get denied by tight security restrictions. I literally find ways to get through all of my obstacles...Te and Ne just barrel through everything. I send out emails to get assistance to start legal stuff tomorrow.

,ESTJ,"Heyyyy.  Not sure how active this place is, but just curious to hear some of your experiences with “relaxing” and making time for yourself. I’m concerned my mom doesnt make enough time to enjoy herself. Or how to.

my Mother seems to always stretch herself thin and even voluntarily makes more work for herself (sometimes as a control thing).  Last summer I stayed with her and my stepdad while I was home from Grad School and i noticed she basically is always busy, and when she’s not, she somehow finds a way to stay busy. She’s a lawyer who works from home, but has all these other side jobs, family obligations with her mom, etc) I don’t understand this and wanted to hear some perspective

There were times my ESFP stepdad and i were hanging out on our laptops in the living room and she would be so ON at 11 at night just doing all this stuff around the house and walked back and forth so much within 30 min that my stepdad and I started to get anxious and just sat there laughing without having to say what we were laughing about LOL.  And the weirdest part is, whenever i proactively tried to get in there and help or take over, she would be pushy about not wanting me to do it bc she likes it done right away and exactly how she wants. I started doing my own laundry when she wasnt home bc i felt too guilty. But then she will also play the martyr later when she says she’s pooped, and starts listing off all the things she accomplished that day in a lowkey humble brag tone.

We met 2 months ago when school started randomly getting iced tea in the cafeteria. I said hi to be polite and I can’t even remember what happened but he just interested me so much. He was so stoic and professional but he gets this look in his eyes of softness when he’s learning something or curious. At first, he seemed so unsure about sharing things about himself with me, but loved hearing me speak about my life and ideas.

He opened up pretty quickly the more I kept popping in to see him, I kept coming during our planning periods or lunch breaks to his classroom hahaha. We could talk for hours about anything. We texted and called whenever we could, met whenever we could. He eventually shared he had been divorced from a toxic marriage and has a 7 year old daughter with shared custody. He said he didn’t mention it immediately cause he is very private about that stuff for safety reasons. 

Yeah… that hit me like a bomb… I thought things were going way too perfect, there had to be a catch. I’ve never hit any of those big milestones in my life. He said they have a system for their daughter and he filed and been done with her for years and she is engaged to someone else. So I trust his word but I was so bothered cause I couldn’t believe I was considering being with someone who did the things I really valued as my/our “first times”. I never ever thought I’d consider dating someone who was already married , let alone have a child. 


I really wrestled with that in my mind for weeks. We had a big talk last week about my insecurities, my problems, my fear of him feeling jaded and not wanting to commit again cuz he already got other commitments. He assured me he wants to commit again and have a gf/eventual wife to come home to and I shouldn’t even worry rn about being a stepmom etc.  cause he can financially and emotionally provide for his kid. 

I’m still nervous for the future but he makes me feel so safe and comfortable, I can’t imagine turning him down now when every day all I find are more reasons to like him. He thinks about me all the time (in a lovey dovey way) and he says it’s heavy for him cuz he isn’t used to that, I know he’s surely an ESTJ but I was so surprised he is falling for me so fast too, he said it must really mean something special cuz that’s not common for him.

I’m honestly so head over heels for this man, he cares so much about my acts of service, he admires and respects me so much, he is so open minded and emotionally intelligent and shares with me all the ways he teaches himself to control his emotions so that he can take care of his mental health. It’s so cute, he makes little promises to himself to never get mad about little things again, like people eating his food from the fridge over the years. Omg it’s so freakin cute 

He’s so good, it’s hard to think of walking away. We are exclusive but not official yet, he told me he will take me to a surprise restaurant in a week after the break (and I hope he asks me to be his girlfriend cuz we already know we want to be serious!!) I’ve never had a guy plan and take me to a restaurant, I know it’s normal but I feel like I don’t deserve it. I’m still nervous about stepping into this but I don’t wanna run away cuz what if I miss out on something great???

,ESTJ," I am an INTP, was homeschooled, and while I loved it I felt like there was something missing with no one to really mentor me in my scientific interests.  Now I have an ESTJ little girl who loves doing hands on things (I hate doing hands on things), and I know I need to do more to support her interests.

She's in 4th grade.  She can light a fire, cook most of our meals, and we have chickens she enjoys taking care of.  When she's at grandma's she sews and crafts up a storm, but we live farther away now so visits are infrequent.  She dreams a lot about the future - running a preschool or babysitting when she's a teen, building her own little cabin (mostly dwelling on the interior decorating), and having a farm.  She also starts planning birthday parties about a year in advance.  I think if I got her into theater and set design she would excel.  She'll say things like, if I turn this book into a TV show, I'd use this particular song for this scene, like she can somehow picture the whole thing.

Even though she has poured through every cookbook and craft book we have, she wants to order a school-related box kit for cooking that gets mailed in monthly.  I think it goes beyond the excitement of getting something in the mail.  Can someone please explain to me why you would want to do an activity that someone else designs and tells you how and what to do, instead of picking your own recipe from a cookbook?  

Our academics are pretty open-ended, and I'm not sure if that works best for her, but I don't know what would be optimal.  I'm hoping if someone can explain what makes an assigned cooking kit more attractive than baking whatever you want, I will have the missing piece...  I'm torn between believing she needs more structure and group activities in a day, and her disliking anything I tell her to do, maybe because I need to change my teaching style and come up with some learning-related projects.  But why wouldn't coming up with her own projects be good enough?  That's where I don't quite get it.

Homeschoolong can be quite flexible so I have no doubt that we will eventually optimize homeschooling to something she will thrive in.  For me if I understand how something works than I can do it.  So someone please tell me how her little brain works, and I'll be set. :D.

Thinking back about him, I liked him because of how talkative he was. And yeah he was a little mean sometimes but he did have valuable insight.
I mean, you seem to me like you are more alive than a lot of people. We would laugh so hard together, I remember in class just looking at him and starting to laugh because we couldn't stop saying dumb shit. We liked to share opinions about anything (yeah we loved talking trash about anything), but that isn't a bad thing. He also was a lot more confident than myself, he could talk with almost everyone in class (althought not everyone liked him).

Not with a lot of people I've been able to get to know each other so well. I mean, maybe he was more of an estp, I don't know, but he did also listened to what I had to say and follow me on my ideas or interests. I didn't like how compliant of authority he would be sometimes (I hated school, the teachers, all of it) but he would still listen to me  complain about those things and got my point.

,ESTJ,"Hello guys. I've been wondering which Mbti type I am and I relate to these two a lot after a full year of observing myself and gathering information from people about me.

I noticed that I have pretty high Te. I always got called impatient and want to finish things fast so I can move on to the next task I have in mind. I do not like unnecessary things that waste my time such as people complaining about something that could be fixed or just ignored easily etc.

I also don’t give up if something goes wrong, Of course I question myself and my abilities a little to the point I may even doubt my decisions but I always believe that I can learn from my mistakes for the future and that there are many possibilities that can fix things or bring us to a different path in life,

I like to be prepared for things and tend to ‘panic’ in ways of anger or raising my voice if I lack details for example for a meeting. I like to have all all my questions solved to prepare myself from the unknown so yeah uncertainty was always a big anxiety factor for me.

I am good at observing people. For example their body language. I never had a partner but I know a log just by observing other people’s relationships and I give a lot of advice for life to my bestfriend. I just have to look at a person to know what kind of person they are. Some say I am like a psychic? But for me it’s just connection the dots of many years of observation.

My sister is an INFP and my mother would always say that I am the leading, logical type while my sister is the emotional one.

Many agreed with my “leading personality” and being “dominant”. I didnt know that I got seen that way,

my best friend says I am pretty logical too but they like my advice and support.

I love to help people I care about so I always make sure to be prepared with my best friend. I make sure that they eat well and aren’t lonely. I just show love through service.

My childhood was emotionally a bit rough so now I am treating people with more kindness and openness. I make sure everyone feels understood, seen, involved and loved. If I was a leader I would be a very people oriented one that respects and observes everyones strengths and weaknesses and eventually acts how it fits each individual.

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know who I am but I am slowly figuring things out.

I take things literally and can sometimes come across as dense.

I get confused when people say something but then do the opposite. I follow rules so why do people not follow them?

I am female and 21  years old.

I never had good grades in school, just average, because I simply put no effort into studying. School was a rough time for me and I began skipping it at high school because I isolate myself when I am sad and have no support system.

I am a student now in my third year

I am open for other appropriate questions or even mbti suggestions, if you noticed something.

,ESTJ,"Hi ESTJs,

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR,

As a person who is on the receiving hand of the grudge with an unhealthy ESTJ, how can I get out of this?? Also, how can I make them not see me a rival just because I exist? I am the least competitive person on earth.

I was right he was wrong but I still want to be on friendly terms.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story:

I had a fall out with an unhealthy ESTJ at work (enneagram 3 with strong 8 in tritype). They were very nice to me in the beginning because they thought they could benefit from me, I sensed this all along but it was okay - I mean they were nice in the end, and then they had a change of mind because now they believe I am a rival. Literally, a more authoritative figure put this in their mind that only one of us could exist. This is not true by the way but he wants to have it all. This led to arguments because well, - unhealthy ESTJ-, but also he was wrong and I was right and he knows I am right but he wants his own way, and it has come spilling that he never treated me as an equal. He just used my name to get projects, and then basically left me out on them. The first argument was bad, he had to comply but never acknowledged this in talks, he did not have a follow-up chat, no apology.

After a while, I pretended it didn't happen and went back to being friendly but cautious because I was on good terms with his wife too but of course, he was tense and annoyed around me, like you feel that even when he is faking he is so tense. I felt relieved in a way because felt relieved and free. Then came another argument because he literally just tried to do the same thing, basically saw that he needed to add me to a project as there was no way around it but this time his target was actually to get someone else to work with them, and get them in the project. I confronted him and asked what had changed his mind, but only asked this when we all met, and he basically had a short fuse and got super argumentative. Afterwards said I was not right to bring it up in front of others, but he was the one who invited me to the meeting and had no talks to address the former situation.

So basically he is argumentative, callous, super mega competitive, and I am not even in the game. He also said shocking things to me before, like how he doesn't care about clients and they can go to hell, bragged about having others do the work for him, and said he never does technical work anymore, but around others, he goes and brags about how he cares about clients, and how the clients come to him to say thank you, says he basically couldn't live if he didn't get to do the technical part and that he was offered a lot of money but he turned down those job offers blah blah. I know he has had these problems at his past workplace too and almost had his career ended but I was nice to him then when not all were. I also covered for him at times. Also has been described as working like a maniac by former colleagues even when I didn't ask about it, it is crazy how competitive he is. Seconded from his wife as well.

Now it is clear we can't work together, but it bothers me that he is always so tense and furious, and as stupid as this is I want to get on good terms and keep his wife as a friend and the friend circle we share. - He can keep friends only if they are working on different topics (read no rival). He can do what he wants because everything has to be ""his way, get his name"" apparently, I just don't want to be on his radar. I am not being competitive with him and I don't think he has any reason to believe this. I am a person who sabotages myself, all my wars are with myself and I am chill and even lazy at work, I have trouble concentrating - it is painful. It is true that I get some things fall in line for me, not because I work hard but because I see the bigger picture and am good with people. I am not in any way competitive and I wish he would stop seeing me as a rival.

Is there hope? How should I go about it? Apology is out of the question, I was right but that is not the point. Just want to be on good terms. I feel that he may like me as a rival, keeps him fueled and what not. Wish it had the same effect on me.",t2_b2qvlf03,False,,0,False,Unhealthy ESTJ colleague/friend - how to get back on good terms,[],r/ESTJ,False,,,0,,False,t3_16658qo,False,light,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question/Advice,False,2,,False,False,,1693471421.0,,[],{},,True,,1693470462.0,text,,,,text,self.ESTJ,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi ESTJs,&lt;/p&gt;

,ESTJ,"Hello! It's been a few years since I've been following a Brazilian influencer in computer science, who I now realize is an ESTJ. The thing is, many people don't like him and his content for a few reasons.

\- He's extremely practical and straightforward in his manner.

\- Apparently, he's very disciplined.

\- If he thinks something is rubbish or stupid, he'll just say it, plain and simple, without holding back. Which can come off as arrogant.

Michael Caloz
Ni: 11
Ne, Te: 10
Ti: 9
Se: 6
Fe: 5
Si, Fi: 4

They answered very truthfully and diligently. But the thing is, they had a very hard time answering the questions; they have a very weak sense of identity. I'm pretty positive about Michael Caloz as far as tests go, but this time I'm not even sure if those results are even usable.

Similar Minds

They had a lot of things to say about questions like ""Are you sailing your own course?"" - Messaged me with questions like, ""What does that mean? Doesn't everyone sail their own course?"" 

Seemed a pretty straightforward question to me. 

Then, ""Obviously I sail my own course. But is it a course I like? Is it a course I want to be on?"" 

They read a bit about INFJ and said ""I recognize myself in some of it but it just seems too artistic for me. Also some of the things just seem too serious (the things INFJ want to achieve in life, e.g. leading people): 

""Seriously? I'm not Ghandi."" 

Then we went over ISTJ - they looked over some characteristics and had to say the following thing: 

""Decisive? Absolutely not."" 

""Cares about the rules? Couldn't care less unless I'm going to jail for it."" 

""Insensitive to others? In my head, yes, but I would never let that show. I always cater to other people's feelings and do everything in my power to ensure that everyone around me is happy with a certain decision even if I don't agree myself - even if it makes me really upset, because I hate making others uncomfortable. I'd rather have me miserable than someone else."" (Wow?) 

""They fail to pick up on the emotional signals given by other people? I'm very good at picking up emotional signals which ties back to the need to ensure that everyone is happy around me. If we're in a group setting and someone says something that hurts someone else, but they don't show it - I will always pick up on that, so I would say I'm good at reading people."" 

""This personality also seems to efficient and productive. I feel like I procrastinate too much for that. But otherwise the key characteristics I very much agree with."" 

Also gave me some examples of their behaviour: 

""When cooking everything has to be perfect, and after every step everything has to be cleaned. I have to have a plan and execute it well, otherwise it becomes meaningless and I just want to give up.""

""When watching a movie I get upset when others aren't watching as attentively as I am, and aren't analyzing every scene and trying to understand the characters. I hate it when someone picks up their phone while we're watching.""

I figure their Fe must be quite high. They also show a lot of Te, I think. Possibly an example is that, instead of pursuing her passions, they focus more on benefits and a path that guarantuees long term profit.

So, again, we already went over ISTJ which they say is too strategic and productive, and INFJ they say is too artistic and people-focused. Definitely not a lot of Se or Ne either. When I gave them a list of characteristics they checked off INFJ, INTJ, ENTJ, ISTJ and ISTP. And with temperaments they go for SJ and NT. I have known them for years, but they are a real riddle to me.

&lt;p&gt;They had a lot of things to say about questions like &amp;quot;Are you sailing your own course?&amp;quot; - Messaged me with questions like, &amp;quot;What does that mean? Doesn&amp;#39;t everyone sail their own course?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seemed a pretty straightforward question to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, &amp;quot;Obviously I sail my own course. But is it a course I like? Is it a course I want to be on?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They read a bit about INFJ and said &amp;quot;I recognize myself in some of it but it just seems too artistic for me. Also some of the things just seem too serious (the things INFJ want to achieve in life, e.g. leading people): &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Seriously? I&amp;#39;m not Ghandi.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we went over ISTJ - they looked over some characteristics and had to say the following thing: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Decisive? Absolutely not.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Cares about the rules? Couldn&amp;#39;t care less unless I&amp;#39;m going to jail for it.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Insensitive to others? In my head, yes, but I would never let that show. I always cater to other people&amp;#39;s feelings and do everything in my power to ensure that everyone around me is happy with a certain decision even if I don&amp;#39;t agree myself - even if it makes me really upset, because I hate making others uncomfortable. I&amp;#39;d rather have me miserable than someone else.&amp;quot; (Wow?) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They fail to pick up on the emotional signals given by other people? I&amp;#39;m very good at picking up emotional signals which ties back to the need to ensure that everyone is happy around me. If we&amp;#39;re in a group setting and someone says something that hurts someone else, but they don&amp;#39;t show it - I will always pick up on that, so I would say I&amp;#39;m good at reading people.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This personality also seems to efficient and productive. I feel like I procrastinate too much for that. But otherwise the key characteristics I very much agree with.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also gave me some examples of their behaviour: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When cooking everything has to be perfect, and after every step everything has to be cleaned. I have to have a plan and execute it well, otherwise it becomes meaningless and I just want to give up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When watching a movie I get upset when others aren&amp;#39;t watching as attentively as I am, and aren&amp;#39;t analyzing every scene and trying to understand the characters. I hate it when someone picks up their phone while we&amp;#39;re watching.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figure their Fe must be quite high. They also show a lot of Te, I think. Possibly an example is that, instead of pursuing her passions, they focus more on benefits and a path that guarantuees long term profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, again, we already went over ISTJ which they say is too strategic and productive, and INFJ they say is too artistic and people-focused. Definitely not a lot of Se or Ne either. When I gave them a list of characteristics they checked off INFJ, INTJ, ENTJ, ISTJ and ISTP. And with temperaments they go for SJ and NT. I have known them for years, but they are a real riddle to me. That might be on me, though... 😅&lt;/p&gt;

,ESTJ,"MBTI Theory may or may not lack a proper scientific base but since studying cognitive functions, I've found them to be able to near-perfectly explain why and how I do almost anything and how my brain works.

Then again, that could just be my Ti brain ending up making placebo-forced connections (since I can rationalize anything) and I might've even made those if I looked up the wrong function set. Although that last statement already assumes I use Ti in the first place which is just circular reasoning... yeah nvm...

MBTI basically got me out of the ""everyone must think like me"" belief and I found out that not everyone values logic over emotion or tradition etc. I wondered then if this could be a way to figure out someone's motives, values, and thought processes (to know where they're coming from) so as to not look at everything as black or white

So basically I wanted to get multiple perspectives on this:

Do you relate to your type's functions? And if so is it more than other functions?

Do you think it's a placebo or not? Did you know something about your thought process that clicked when you read a certain function?

Do the function definitions explain why and how you live your life and do certain things?

Please elaborate as much as you can.

,ESTJ,"I've seen other posts about this in the past but too bad. [16personalities.com](http://16personalities.com/) and some people say Gordon Ramsay is an ENTJ but I don't buy it and a lot of other people think he's an ESTJ as well.

Feel free to share your thoughts!

He's very particular and has strong opinions about how things should be done, he seems to have strong Si because he cares a lot how a dish tastes and is passionate about food. Also ESTJs and ENTJs talk very differently, it's hard to explain. I might not agree with what an ESTJ says but it's not over my head. And he may seem like a visionary but I think he could have achieved what he has through hard work, self-improvement, and learning and trying new things, rather than having worked toward some goal in the future. 

I hate that he swears so much, yet as someone who works in hospitality I relate to him in some ways. I know you can't completely judge his personality by his shows (I've watched a couple interviews too but have never met him of course). But as an example there was an episode where he finally gives up on a hotel owner because a 20-year-old server was able to tell the chicken was dry, but he said, ""It's raw"".  I think an ENTJ would rely more on their intuition and not point to a specific example like that, yet he always seems to have an example when he makes a point. And I totally relate to this because I get annoyed when people who have done their jobs for years don't seem to know what they're doing, because they do something that might seem little to others, but to me it's a red flag. Of course, I make those kinds of mistakes as well and am hard on myself too, whether or not it's right.

He has a good sense of humor sometimes but anyone can have a sense of humor so I hesitate to say that's because he's an ESTJ. He's mean sometimes (which is possibly just for dumb American TV) but is relatively polite to employees and others and this video of him ""actually being nice"" is very wholesome: [https://youtu.be/xXK0iNRbKZk](https://youtu.be/xXK0iNRbKZk) ",t2_aubclyxa,False,,0,False,I think Gordon Ramsay's an ESTJ,[],r/ESTJ,False,,,0,,False,t3_157kce3,False,light,0.84,,public,4,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion/Poll,False,4,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1690132430.0,text,,,,text,self.ESTJ,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen other posts about this in the past but too bad. &lt;a href=""http://16personalities.com/""&gt;16personalities.com&lt;/a&gt; and some people say Gordon Ramsay is an ENTJ but I don&amp;#39;t buy it and a lot of other people think he&amp;#39;s an ESTJ as well.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve posted this in other subs as well but really interested in what you ESTJs think about this!

I’m trying to help my ISTJ mom release anger from the past. She is physically ill because of it. We are unsure how to process her anger. Her entire life, she has actively downplayed emotions, avoiding arguments / bottling everything. She feels deeply wronged by someone and even after 20 years, feels troubled by it.  

She’s also hyper realistic and asks if there’s even a point to expressing the anger (because the person passed away &amp; she cannot get closure). She also doesn’t want to cause disharmony to people around us by complaining. 

I’m kind of lost as to how to help her get catharsis and how to explain to her the importance of getting it out. I’m not good at emotions myself. 

I’ve listened to her vent the same things a lot and am happy to listen to more. 

1. Does venting the same things over and over make you feel better? 
2. Does anyone here have ideas on activities that gives *SATISFACTION*. Maybe stuff like writing letters, yelling at the top of the mountain etc. I think it’d be super fun to do it with her, I could probably use it too
3. What works for you? How do you heal from emotions? How does it work?

,ESTJ,"Curious as to whether anyone else is in a similar situation or is familiar with such a relationship. 

I’ve been with my boyfriend for four years (I’m a late-30s ESTJ woman; he’s an early-50s ESFJ man). We have a great partnership, but not much emotional or other intimacy. He takes care of the home, does the dishes, gardens, cleans, and cares for our dog while I am at work. He is very set in his ways, but far more feelings-oriented than I am.

I am much more direct and thinking-oriented rather than feelings-oriented, the latter of which I struggle with. Hence, our communication often suffers. I’m also admittedly not that great or interested in doing chores. I enjoy work, as does he (I’m in a quality program management/engineering position, and have been with my company for 15 years; he works in the restaurant industry — and we contribute equally to finances; I am the homeowner but he owns another property he rents out). But when I get home, I just want to relax, and that causes some conflict as he feels (understandably) like he’s always the caregiver of our home. We also sleep in separate rooms; I’m a night owl and he is an early bird. 

Before Covid hit, I used to go to happy hour all the time after work, but rarely do so these days.

,ESTJ,"
Hello my friends! This is a request for some of your advice and thoughts (from a 25m ENFP). 

I am in the U.S born &amp; raised n currently in the middle of a formal more traditional courtship process (typical timeline goes as follows: connect via friends recommending we’d be a match, text, calls, video calls etc then if things go well connect with her family and move forward from there. Can go from a few weeks to a few months process) with a 25f ESTJ. We have been talking for a few weeks now and we surprisingly have a lot of similar interests, similar career goals, similar religious beliefs, generally similar fields (although she has much higher education than me and is much further in the field 😆 classic ESTJ behavior which I am happy for her for hahaha she is very hardworking). So at a high level I would say that most things are solid + I am attracted to her from what I’ve seen pictures &amp; her for me as well. I understand this is pretty left field compared to the typical western 

I have a few concerns and I’m not sure if they are valid or if I’m just in over my head with my assumptions regarding her and her personality so far. From our convos and talking I’ve learned from her and from some of her friends whom I’ve inquired about her for that she is a pretty blunt and to the point person as well as that she doesnt really know how to express her emotions too well in some ways/scenarios. And this makes sense to me to a level due to her cognitive stacking with NeFi as the weaker and TeSi main &amp; how she’s just always been to the point, efficiency, getting things done, never been in a romantic relationship etc. Not to say she’s not kind and a good person, she very much is so based on her actions/involvement in community etc— but I bring this up bc as an ENFP (completely opposite ordered cognitive stacking as her hahaha) I am very much a heavy feeler and expresser of emotions, and I would love to be able to receive a lot from my partner whatever it is physical touch, words of affirmation etc but I am worried that these things are so foreign to her and giving is so normal for me &amp; the relationship would end up being one sided even if she was into me just due to the way she currently is. I say currently bc I know people can grow and love grows, compromises made for eachother, extra steps you take for the ones you love etc but I just feel weird thinking about our dynamic in the long run lol ENFP &amp; ESTJ but I do know that I really like her. (I know the functions and categories are not just slap a stick and boom that’s what you are but I am just letting my mind wander which is not always the most productive thing🥲) I am no scholar or organized like many SJ’s are but I have definitely proactively worked hard on and continue to work on being more organized, disciplined and routine just for my own personal development and businesses. 

Alongside that during our calls she has noted that she appreciates directness/not beating around the bush so I’ve followed suit when it comes to certain questions/topics and im just straight about them. Occasionally she tells me she enjoys talking to me (after I ask how she’s feeling) &amp; we are laughing having a good time connecting etc but I still feel a bit off lol not sure if it’s my anxious attachment or what as majority of the time it’s like a 70/30 split skewed my way I’d say when it comes to us asking eachother questions/posing things to talk about. When we start talking then we keep it rolling very easily and naturally flows tho. I get it that the guy usually takes the lead but it’s really hard for me get a read on her lol. We plan on meeting up in person soon, but prior to that we are still in this stage lol I’m not a fan of this stage in general but it has to be gone thru.

I'm a 20 year old guy, and the pull to disassociate with who I know I am is very tempting, to think of myself as an ""intuitive"", to stretch the truth just a bit and live a lie. But I can't, and sometimes I find myself wanting to indulge that feeling of self growth and improvement, but alas, the lack of content for ESTJs and general disdain we face online tears me up inside. I really like this community centered around typology, but I have a hard time parsing out ""who"" I should listen to (Fe) instead of ""what"" content is credible or not. That's a big downside. The worst thing is knowing that my Ni is non-existent, getting whooped in the derriere for three consecutive games of chess by an ESTP in front of both mine and the ESTP's mutual crush.

""Why not try and improve my Ni??? If I get enough input as to how it works, I can reverse engineer it with Ne and map out linear contingencies with Si, thus producing a similar result."" The aforementioned thought process has been eating at my brain recently. Reverse engineering Ni would open many doors for calculative behavior, but for my ESTP friend's case, I would have to do the same thing with Ti, and I'm not sure that the end result would be worth my time and energy.

If we naturally take our own functions for granted, and the typology community generally has negative inputs for our own type, then generally speaking there's a high probability that many of us are not going to feel very good about ourselves. I'm doing what I can to change that by posting things like this and getting my thoughts out into writing to help me process things.

On a lighter note, most people I talk to who have a rudimentary understanding of typology (I'm talking 16p here) typically say I'm highly intelligent and then type me as an intuitive. This gives more credence towards me wanting to live a lie and go with the flow so to speak but if I'm being honest with myself I take in information abundantly in a more exploratory intuitive sense, reaching the farthest corners of the internet/books (Ne) and find the solids in the info soup with which to make trajectory based calculations via Si.

I do want to preface my statement about intelligence with how I believe it works for Si-Ne users. For me, I have to go to the info, input it into my brain via taking notes/reading and go through the process of systematically using the info in a sort of formulaic way (Like algebra/calculus) and then finally seeing how that process can be congruent or different from other processes I've used, splicing them together and sectioning them off to make new ones. That happens with all types of info, and those processes are stored with a recall-rate of 70-80% in my case (guesstimated).

So I guess that leads me to the thought that I sometimes feel as if I was just a robot, but I know that's not the case. I do my very best to understand people and how they operate (going as far as to learn Socionics) and I'm just sometimes bummed that people are ok with such a rudimentary understanding of typology.

I'm definitely not the best MBTI type to support and help my husband as I've been encouraging his tertiary Ne and he has become a multitasking monster with 10 different projects open, unwilling to narrow them down and putting himself in a rut because of overwork. And the few times I've tried to encourage him to prioritize projects he ends up with even more projects... If not for his dom Te and inferior Fi I would have labeled him an ENTP with how scattered he is right now. He is so focused on trying to start a business but can't commit to one thing. He is wasting all of his energy by not planning things through. 

How should I go about this? I'm guessing he is in a TeNe loop and I have no idea how to break him out of it. What would you guys prefer your partner do to support you through times like these?

,ESTJ,"Hello hello, ENFP here 👋

I hope you guys are doing well in your subreddit. Randomly mentioning you guys’ type, I am once again reminded of how great you guys can be. The dynamic ENFP-ESTJ isn’t the most common, but although challenging, it is still a workable, fruitful relationship when both parties put the work (like anything, BUT we share the same functions! *slay*)

My grandma is an ESTJ. For the longest time, I viewed her as “stuck in her ways”, “annoying-nagging”, “inconsiderate” and “mocking of others”. Depending on how you look at it, some of her flaws are still present, but there is **so much more** than that. She’s a very caring person, never fails to help the family financially and practically when she can (and even when she really can’t, she does it anyway). Her ‘old ways’ are just habits of how she feels *comfort* in doing things. There isn’t anything outdated with it, as long it matters to her. The nagging is just because she pushes you to become a better person and do what you must to succeed. Or how things could be done more effectively, yikes!

Even though it looks like she’s inconsiderate, she pays attention deeply to others, only it doesn’t show on the surface that she cares about you or prizes something that has been done. Thank you grandma.

Thank you, French teacher and Arts teacher for complaining that we students should do more and not be lazy, study harder and be the best self as we can become. Thank you for explaining things in different ways a thousand times for us, dumb bastards *that sometimes couldn’t care less about your subject*. All your effort is being appreciated now. *forces all classmates to bow down magically*

And thank **each of you** for being who you are, regardless of the many people that have called you insensitive/boring/stubborn/judgmental/serious/perfectionist. Truth is, they couldn’t see past your true intentions and well-meaning. 

Let live and move on. You’ll find more worthwhile people that will value you if you already haven’t.

Honest question.

And the way I see it, with your sharp Te and your playful Ne most of you estjs must be a bit like that too, or at the very least, very sarcastic (which seems to be attributed to intjs/istps more often).

He is quite the estj though - blunt, efficient, task-oriented, *stubborn*. But also so funny and easy-going.

So, the question is, is he the odd one out or do you all value humor quite a lot? And if my assumption is correct and you're all quite funny, how come *this* fact never sticks but the rest of the stupid cliches about you do?

,ESTJ,"Hey

The past couple of years I've been reading about mbti, cognitive functions, and taken tests. Ive gotten these types as results, xntj, xstj,and xstp. 

I was reluctant to even ask in an stj group as I read constantly that they are strict rule followers and I'm not...however I'm constantly compared to my mom (stj) and my wife after reading about types says xstj is the closest in her opinion.

The only thing for sure I know is that I'm an xxTx. Not sure if Te or Ti as I tend to get a split on these and I relate to both. 

Based off these generic answers what would you say the type is

Planner or improvisers

I'm flexible. I prefer planning but can be flexible if things come up. Overall all I want is that I'M the one who chooses and dictates what I do.

Practical or abstract

Both

Structured or unstructured environments

Structured

Do you frequently do things without a specific schedule or plan.

I want the freedom to choose to have a schedule or not. I do have a loose morning routine and I do my best to not have it interrupted. I dislike having things sprung upon me.

Do you think rules and regulations are necessary

Yes, the ones that make sense

5 words to describe myself(this is from close friends/loved ones)

Persistent/Determined

Confident

Rebellious

Impatient

Physical

I like to face problems head on

I stay objective when making decisions

No problem confronting others

I think about the present and how it'll affect the future

I like to understand the framework being used to make a decision

I cannot stand being micro managed

I do not like needy people

Been described as a Jock/nerd combo

I weightlift 5 days a week, hike, surf etc

Used to play baseball, hockey, BMX, and heavily into skateboarding when I was younger

I've been a nerd/geek my whole life(you wouldn't know it by looking at me) Big into video games, tabletop rpg DnD.(Usually play as an Ranger ) I like to read sci fi, fantasy, and horror. Used to write but have no time now. Star Trek nerd. Walking encyclopedia of Horror movie trivia

Love music, big part of me. Specifically punk and metal and even more specifically death,power,symphonic. But I enjoy soundtracks, lo fi, instrumentals also

I'm a very loyal dedicated person to those close to me

I'm goofy and loving toward my wife and kids. I like to joke around and make them laugh

I have a movie room I made

I dont like being late to work or appointments. Something my parents instilled in me.(moms an istj, dad's an isfj, and sis is an estj) I butted heads with them constantly and still do. There conservatives religious, I'm liberal and athiest

Logic/Rational minded

Ambitious and always wanting to learn

Heavily into the tattoos and piercing scene

Worked retail jobs and never lasted. My job now is more being your own boss, do your thing, rarely managed. Best job so far

Blunt

Doer/Realist

I'm open minded

I ask why a lot, I want to know what I'm about to do make sense and not waste time 

I like make tier lists

,ESTJ,"ESTJs are definitely one of the most negatively stereotyped of the 16 personalities/cog function stacks. However, unlike the others, we never see ESTJs defending themselves in posts or posting things that defy their norms bc there’s so little of u on here. Also, unlike the other most negatively stereotyped MBTIs, I know none of u so I can’t point to an example of someone I know and say how they defy their stereotypes. 

In case you’re interested, here’s how friends of mine with negatively stereotyped MBTIs break their stereotypes:

ENTJ:
The ENTJs I’ve been close to defy the ENTJ stereotypes in so many ways, but if you ignore the stereotypes and focus on their cognitive functions, it couldn’t be more obvious. (They do still fit some stereotypes though, like they’re both very stubborn and can come off as controlling). They’re both two of the most artsy people I know, and one of them is a vegan hippie anarchist while the other is a butch emo stoner. 

ISTJ: 
The ISTJs I’ve been close to defy their stereotypes as well. Out of the 4 ISTJs I’ve been close to, only one was the slightest bit robotic. She did match the stereotypes in many ways, and in extreme amounts, but was also very quirky and a quiet anti-social emo kid. She also enjoyed art and writing. 2 of them were hella sassy, funny, and cool which is not ever described as an ISTJ and is kinda contradictory to the common stereotypes on here. The fourth ISTJ I’ve been close to (and dated..) is a doctor by day, and the biggest fuck boii (low-key chad vibes) by night. 

ESFJ: 
I can only think of two ESFJs I’ve been close to. Ig I’m not the kinda person to attract the popular &amp; basic kind of ESFJ or pop &amp; basic friend in general lol. Well actually they both were popular in their own way. One of them is a stripper. I was involved with her gf (they were poly). She was VERY popular with the men and her many adult friends adored her. But in her teenage years, she used to beat people up. She’s also a college drop out. The other ESFJ, is my long-time friend. She’s always been friends with the popular kids but an outcast weirdo at the same time. She also had a period in her childhood where she would beat people up. She even was sometimes aggressive with me when we were young (hair-pulling, hitting, shoving). She was also extremely controlling. She would bully my other best friend bc she wanted me to herself. My other best friend at the time (ISTP) found it hilarious though.

However, unlike the others, we never see ESTJs defending themselves in posts or posting things that defy their norms bc there’s so little of u on here. Also, unlike the other most negatively stereotyped MBTIs, I know none of u so I can’t point to an example of someone I know and say how they defy their stereotypes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you’re interested, here’s how friends of mine with negatively stereotyped MBTIs break their stereotypes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ENTJ:
The ENTJs I’ve been close to defy the ENTJ stereotypes in so many ways, but if you ignore the stereotypes and focus on their cognitive functions, it couldn’t be more obvious. (They do still fit some stereotypes though, like they’re both very stubborn and can come off as controlling). They’re both two of the most artsy people I know, and one of them is a vegan hippie anarchist while the other is a butch emo stoner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISTJ: 
The ISTJs I’ve been close to defy their stereotypes as well. Out of the 4 ISTJs I’ve been close to, only one was the slightest bit robotic. She did match the stereotypes in many ways, and in extreme amounts, but was also very quirky and a quiet anti-social emo kid. She also enjoyed art and writing. 2 of them were hella sassy, funny, and cool which is not ever described as an ISTJ and is kinda contradictory to the common stereotypes on here. The fourth ISTJ I’ve been close to (and dated..) is a doctor by day, and the biggest fuck boii (low-key chad vibes) by night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ESFJ: 
I can only think of two ESFJs I’ve been close to. Ig I’m not the kinda person to attract the popular &amp;amp; basic kind of ESFJ or pop &amp;amp; basic friend in general lol. Well actually they both were popular in their own way. One of them is a stripper. I was involved with her gf (they were poly). She was VERY popular with the men and her many adult friends adored her. But in her teenage years, she used to beat people up. She’s also a college drop out. The other ESFJ, is my long-time friend. She’s always been friends with the popular kids but an outcast weirdo at the same time. She also had a period in her childhood where she would beat people up. She even was sometimes aggressive with me when we were young (hair-pulling, hitting, shoving). She was also extremely controlling. She would bully my other best friend bc she wanted me to herself. My other best friend at the time (ISTP) found it hilarious though. However, in recent years, she has found god, and is now a very easy-going and nice person. lol.&lt;/p&gt;

I hate people.

I hate it when random morons keep interacting with me and disturb my daydreaming. People ALWAYS need help with something, and I don't wanna solve it (it's my job, I'm a front desk attendent/security guard in a luxury apartment complex, but I don't really care...?). How can I stop repressing my anger and tell people that I want them to piss off? How do I create red lines?

I want to focus on my own inner world, imagination, creativity. Not on helping people I don't even care about.

And when I'm home people constantly open the door to my room to talk to me about trivial nonsense (and the damn PROLOGUE! Get to the darn point, losers). It causes so much built up stress my brain goes numb and I feel like my heart is going to burst out of my throat. And by extention, that means it silences my creativity and train of thought along with any willingness to take action. It just doesn't stop. I'd live in a remote planet if I could. I can't stand it anymore.

A human within my vicinity = Instant wrath and anxiety

,ESTJ,"Hello estj's. If you care for a little read, I am in need of your advice, which i trust will be honest and perhaps blunt.

I (infj) have a friend of the opposite gender (e/istj) whom I've known for a decade now. He has always been dear to me, even through periods when we don't speak. We were lightly involved romantically as young teens, nothing serious. As older teens, we didn't go to the same school anymore so we texted every day for years. It almost felt like we were dating with how close we were at the time, yet no boundaries/labels were ever discussed.

Here's where the problem lies: During our older teen years we got \*too close\* over text and once coming to our senses, things became a tad awkward/difficult. We talked amicably and harmlessly for a few months until we both started college, and haven't talked since. He's somewhat out of touch with his emotions, so I never have a clear idea on where we stand (because he can't tell me).

My question: I still get concerned and care for him on some level, and would like to check on him. Should I text him? Should I resist and try my best to forget him? My motive is pure: I genuinely just want to hear what he's up to. I'm not tryna hit him up for anything weird.

I thought it could have to do with some kinda Fi thing..? Not sure.. honestly there are a lot of potential reasons for it but I’m just hoping to find it here or mark this off the list..

Other things that might be the reason is ADHD, Bc of hypersensitivity. But not sure if that explains why my social environment affects it

Im also 16, and female, so it could be hormones. But again, that still doesn’t explain it to me.. 

I think if it does have to do with MBTI then Fi grip? I’ve been crying a lot recently because of school stress and tend to get upset very very quickly with things like my friends conversations.. its pretty bad djsjjsjsjs

,ESTJ,"There's a lot to explain cause all details matter, but I don't wanna keep the night writing, so I'm gonna try to summarize, but I can extend if someone asks for a specific thing.


Currently 23yo.


From 12 - 16yo I was a romantic, feeling things a lot, my emotions were a roller coaster, I was feeling easy in love with college girls just cause ladies were paying attention to me or at least talking… I know it's sad, but I was being bullied, and I needed a bit of care, and I was desperate for someone to treat me well.


From 17-20yo I finish the mandatory studies and I change school to study IT. Having a new environment helps me a lot, cause ppl was now caring for me a bit more, and I was now the one rejecting talking with ppl cause I was so insecure and afraid of leaving the imaginary shield I did build during previous years and experiences. So I start eating healthier, studying something I like also helps me a lot and I start to make friends.


At 19yo, one of my new friends introduces me to calisthenics and I get in shape cause of that. (I'm doing calisthenics since then).


At 20yo, I start my internship in a company and besides all the technical knowledge I keep getting, I hear about cryptocurrency and being to learn about it with some of my internship colleges.


When I finish the internship, covid came and the company can't afford to hire me. So I spent the next 6 months studying cryptocurrency investment now buying a trading academy course and also BTC starts to go up so all my investments get a X3 minimum. I get crazy, I feel like a boss without knowing much about the economy cycles.


We are already at 21yo and I start working for another company as Junior Developer and doing investments as a side hustle, learning more about IT cause the company and learning cryptocurrency cause the trading academy I bought during covid.


At 22yo I got promoted to Analyst (no longer Junior) but my investments start going down as the market was crashing, and I just keep losing money, and I was doing the same things that were giving me money last year.


Anyway, I do wanna know more about self development as controlling your emotions is so important in investments and I start reading self-development books and I create this ""new"" personality where I'm trying to create good habits, keep the good ones, remove the bad ones, learn about communication skills, try to create a drop-shipping website which fails, learn about taxes and laws, while keeping doing calisthenics and eat healthy and rest well and trying to understand my investments, myself

and others.


I've been changing a lot mainly from 21yo to now and financial literacy, professional development, personal development and having healthier relationships with others have changed me so much that I think I'm no longer an ISFJ, as I was at 16yo, and now I'm a ESTJ.


I would like to know your opinion about if that's possible, or it's just my perception… Or even I might be either of those.


I've never paid much attention to the personality type, but I've realized it's a good next step to increase my knowledge about myself.

What are some principles you abide to, especially the non-negotiables?

What are you looking for in a relationship? How do you seek out/“test” your potential partner? 

Do you find yourself seeking a committed relationship or just date around? And are you one to be often found in a relationship or do you find yourself single more often? 

Do you find that your actual real life dating experience differs from what your philosophy/theory of dating is? 

Do you have any fears around dating?

I made a post before about my opinion about Te/Ti functions, and I'm trying to refine it until I reach to the most perfect, systematic, useful and practical understanding and definition for the whole cognitive functions, so here's my refined opinion about Te/Ti

T gives ""meaning"" to the gathered (perceived) informations, and this means that T give the ""reasons"" behind the gathered (perceived) informations

E/I indicate if these informations are given to (executed in) the outside world (Te), or stored in the mind in (the inside world) as a conclusion (Ti)

,ESTJ,"Here is a Spotify playlist of songs I relate to as an ESTJ and also really like, not all ESTJs will. I like making playlists because I have a high opinion of my taste in music lol, although maybe I should learn to stick to a genre. Below are the songs and explanations of why I added them.

Let me know what you think, thanks!

**Playlist** [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6trU2zPzv21qgzO9YEzSX7?si=f5a862ba7cf84ef2](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6trU2zPzv21qgzO9YEzSX7?si=f5a862ba7cf84ef2) 

**I Can’t Stand Still** Personally I’m happier when I’m busy, and I tend to do things fast.

**Wake Me Up** I related to this song when I was in high school and so ready to grow up and be more independent and start my career, though I didn’t know what I wanted to do until the year after high school. Also I relate to, “All this time I’ve been finding myself, and I didn’t know I was lost” I feel like we learn about ourselves as we get older.

**Almost There/I’ll Make a Man Out of You** Tiana, and Li Shang from Mulan are (fictional) ESTJs

**Go the Distance/High Hopes/Stronger** Motivational songs, also Go the Distance is very nostalgic

**Good Girl** “Why you gotta be so blind?” I feel bad for people in bad relationships but I don’t get why they put up with it. I’ve never been in a relationship though so take that with a grain of salt.

**Break My Heart/Ever Fallen in Love** I wouldn’t fall for a bad person but I can still have inconvenient feelings for someone, even if it’s not going to work out. 

**Alive/Rise** More motivational songs

**Superstition** I’m a Christian but I’m still healthily skeptical and try to think logically

**Non-Stop** Alexander Hamilton was supposedly an ENTJ, but close enough

**Don’t Rain on my Parade** Song about standing up for yourself

**Word Crimes** I do hate typos, I don’t generally correct people’s grammar or spelling though.

**Ain’t It Fun** You gotta grow up someday, kid (I’m 27 and I sound 80, oh well)

**My Kind of Love/Love Is Not a Fight** These songs are about love not being a feeling so much as an action, and being loyal to the other person.

**It’s Alright (Send Me)** Billy Graham was an ESTJ and this reminded me of him

**Running Just to Catch Myself** Funny song about working in an office setting (I do, but not in a negative environment like in the song)

**Hey Look Ma I Made It/Moving Out** Both of these are kind of about the negative side of success

**American Pie/Danger Zone** I had to include a couple of songs that just sound nostalgic and the lyrics don't fit the theme, I get nostalgic about songs that were written before I was born because of Si, I think.

**Dare You To Move/Do Something/Brave** Songs about motivating/helping others.

**My Way** Frank Sinatra was an ESTJ, and I don’t agree with the message of this song but it’s cool to see an ESTJ musician.

**Little Wonders** This song thaws my cold heart (jk, but it did make me tear up), I tend to stress out over small stuff but I also want to appreciate the little things that are positive. Side note the end of Meet the Robinsons, where the song is from, is my favorite movie ending ever.",t2_aubclyxa,False,,0,False,ESTJ Playlist!,[],r/ESTJ,False,,,0,,False,t3_12q5ign,False,light,0.86,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Fun!,False,5,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681781953.0,text,,,,text,self.ESTJ,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a Spotify playlist of songs I relate to as an ESTJ and also really like, not all ESTJs will.

I've seen many explanation to Te, and These explanations makes contradictions(I'm not sure if my solutions are right or not, but the fact that these are problems and illogical contradictions is undeniable):

1.some say Te is ""what others think"" or it's ""understanding systems in the outside world"", and they ""look to the facts"" meaning that Te became a perceiving(gathering informations) function and not a judging function (which is completely wrong)

2.some say that Te is about making a strategy or plan, but I think that when you make strategies and plans, you perceive it more than judging it

3. judging and perceiving are the opposite of each other, and this is why when one of them increase, the opposite decrease in your test, so if one of them ""gather informations"" (perceiving), it makes sense to the other function to be the opposite is ""gives informations"" (judging), and what I mean by giving informations is ""execute informations""

so Si Te for example...

,ESTJ,"Hello, I am a 23 year old INTJ 8w7 and I was looking for an ESTJ to be friends with.

The reason is that I realize that I don’t know or understand ESTJs so I wanted to do so.

I’ll be honest, I’m working to get my life together since I was reckless in the past and was depressed from it. I take my adhd medication now and I know you guys get a lot of posts asking for help, that’s not my purpose here. I simply want to get to know an ESTJ.

I’m at the point in my life where I get something done daily and am becoming more disciplined, focusing on habits and mindset.

So I’ll share about me so you can decide if it interests you:

I meditate and read daily, run atleast 3 times a week for an hour. 

I did Muay Thai for 3 months and stopped cause I’m broke rn but intend on going back when I find a new job.

My main focuses in life are Music, Art, filmmaking, coding. No I’m not making money from these nor have I mastered these yet. 

Music: I like to sing, rap, poetry, play piano, produce music and make my own songs. 

Filmmaking: photography, filmmaking itself, video editing.

Coding: just doing cs50 rn going into a program in September.

Art: drawing, graphic design.

These are the disciplines I’m dedicating my life to, and I need them to combine them.

,ESTJ,"Do you too always end up alone at parties/social events?
Even though I initiate conversations, try my best to be a good listener and come up with topics I believe the other person would find interesting, yadda yadda yadda, I always find myself alone somewhere in a corner either talking to people no one else is talking to or just by myself looking for an opportunity to join someone I find interesting to talk to. Even my friends/people who I came with and who, when talking to them 1-on-1, I believe, enjoy talking to me, go on and find other people to talk to.

My gf told me that I often come over as too serious and too stiff and that this could be the reason, but even at serious/business events people never stay around for longer than a few sentences.
Is it because I just can’t fake laugh or talk non-sense for ever? I can hardly imagine that that’s everything other people are talking about all the time, or is it? Am I just always asking the wrong questions at the wrong time?

Is this a common issue with ESTJs? I am starting to think that it’s my face … I have never had problems with my self-esteem but this is really making me feel less confident/attractive and it’s beginning to take a toll on how I percieve myself.

""Ebenezer Scrooge had a point about decreasing surplus populations.""

""Smalltalk should be punishable by death.""

""Let stupid and lazy people die from their own stupidity and laziness. Social darwinism takes no prisoners.""

""Oh screw turning the other cheek. I say 'if some moron smacks you on one cheek,freaking SMASH his head in with an axe and spit on his corpse'. Self-preservation above all else,Nietzsche had the right idea.""



""There really is nothing more satisfying than a loud attention seeking drama queen getting their mouth duct taped shut for the first time ever.""

""My life motto is one very simple;leave me alone or I will kill you.""

""Few things make my blood boil more than someone asking for help from me;I wanna be left alone in peace to do my own thing in the corner and not be distracted. Next time some lazy gossiper asks me for help for anything,my eyes will roll so hard to the back of my head I will get a thousand migraines at once.""

""I just wish we could live in a world where everyone keeps to themselves and leaves each other alone,why is that so goddamn hard to understand?""

""Life isn't pain,some people just suck at it.""



""I am pure misanthropy in physical form.""

'I have an idea:let's create a new religion that basically says:'smart and capable people go to heaven,dumb and weak people go to hell,every man for himself,don't be a leech.'

'Honey badgers are a spirit animal.'

,ESTJ,"So my roommate is an ESTJ and I’m an ENFP and in my persceptive our compatibility is so fluctuating. Sometimes we match really well and we get along well, but sometimes I feel like we just don’t understand eachother and get frustrated. Or at least I do. One thing I struggle with with her is that she is a very bad listener (idk if that is n ESTJ thing or just her thing). In conversations with her she talks a lot and tells a lot of not important details or stories from long ago and I try my best to listen, ask questions and understand what she wants to say. But when I respond to her or tell something myself she gets destracted and then responds, or even interrupts, with something completely off topic totally unbothered by what I just said. She does this with other roommates too and we have talked to her about this a few times but it is a recurring theme. 

You could say maybe she just doesnt find us important enough to care but I know that we are in her closer cirlce and I am one of the few people she opens up to and comes to when she wants to vent her heart (maybe also because I ask her the questions she needs to do so). 

But this way of interacting, where there is very little interaction and ask for depth that does not concern her, asks more of my energy than it gives me. I would appreciate it if she would be more bothered with how I am doing or even see here care about how others are doing.

,ESTJ,"Hey

So I'm somewhat familiar with mbti and cognitive functions. Yet I can't pin point a type. I've tested as an Entj, Estj, and an Estp.(also the introverted versions as well)

Anyways I've been told by some people who are aware of mbti that outwardly I come off stpish. I've been compared to mostly stp and stj characters with occasional ntj ones by my wife and close people. I do tend to relate to all 3 of those types. 

The stp mbti description is fitting but cognitive function wise entj seems to fit me. 

Some random info

I like having things decided. 

I want to get things done and not Ponder for hours. I don't like wasting time.

I'm an auditor and actually enjoy it

I'm told I'm assertive, pushy and relentless

,ESTJ,"I’m a ISFP. We are all in grad school. First time ever taking to ESTJ. It’s just super weird. We saw each other in class all the day and just today we have a zoom group meeting together. I walked up to him in the school building and said that I know him from previous classes, he said something like “oh do we I was too focused when I do things so I never noticed you. “ (weird cuz I talk in class as well, most people knows me) I was like oh make sense you ask lots of bold questions in class. And then we had a heated debate on whether his straightforwardness and ignore the political correctness and insist on the logical thing is a good thing to do in California. And then I asked about his MBTI. He asked me what is it and I explained.he made some bad jokes like “oh nice nice hope school don’t kick me out if I get the wrong result”etc. at that moment I wasn’t sure if he’s interested (in the MBTI or in me) or just polite or etc so I said you don’t have to. But he said I pitched his interest. And when I talked to him and explain my emotional sways of viewings things he called it “fascinating and insightful”. It’s just weird cuz later when I asked his age. I guessed 27 but he laughed and told me the students he’s TAing guesses he’s 36. Then I asked his age again. He told me he’s in School while there’s dinosaurs in there. And then when I show curiosity again,he act a bit uncomfortable and say “now I’m feeling comfortable telling you my age now”. So I wrapped up the conversation and later that day he basically avoided eye contact but did open the door when I was behind him.  I know later he literally graduated the same year as I form college which mean we both are 23. What the fuvk just happened. Did I do something wrong?

I walked up to him in the school building and said that I know him from previous classes, he said something like “oh do we I was too focused when I do things so I never noticed you. “ (weird cuz I talk in class as well, most people knows me) I was like oh make sense you ask lots of bold questions in class. And then we had a heated debate on whether his straightforwardness and ignore the political correctness and insist on the logical thing is a good thing to do in California. And then I asked about his MBTI. He asked me what is it and I explained.he made some bad jokes like “oh nice nice hope school don’t kick me out if I get the wrong result”etc. at that moment I wasn’t sure if he’s interested (in the MBTI or in me) or just polite or etc so I said you don’t have to. But he said I pitched his interest. And when I talked to him and explain my emotional sways of viewings things he called it “fascinating and insightful”. It’s just weird cuz later when I asked his age. I guessed 27 but he laughed and told me the students he’s TAing guesses he’s 36. Then I asked his age again. He told me he’s in School while there’s dinosaurs in there. And then when I show curiosity again,he act a bit uncomfortable and say “now I’m feeling comfortable telling you my age now”. So I wrapped up the conversation and later that day he basically avoided eye contact but did open the door when I was behind him.  I know later he literally graduated the same year as I form college which mean we both are 23. What the fuvk just happened. Did I do something wrong? I’m confused because I thought it was just normal conversation and he shared more things than age. So I dunno if age is a thing??? Or does he hate me??? Or like me??? Wtf just happened?&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been with my company for 14 years.

,ESTJ,"ESTJs who have INTPs as friends, (co)workers and partners, what is your dynamic like?

If you don't have an INTP, what do you think about them in general?

My opinion (Marked as spoiler so you can read if you are interested):

&gt;!I know a few ESTJs myself. My mom is also an ESTJ, and to be fair, our dynamic is great, which is very unlike from what you have probably seen throughout many mbti related subreddits.!&lt;

&gt;!Also, ESTJs that I know are actually fun to hangout with and compared to ENTJs are way more laidback. Truth is, I like ESTJs more than ENTJs. While, our Ti and Te may clash from time to time, the Si and Ne clicks pretty well. !&lt;

&gt;!I personally don't like the picture that is painted by those who don't really understand mbti types. To be exact, I don't like the whole ""ESTJs are bossy assholes"" picture. Hanging with a few of them made me see for myself that they're not really as bossy as that they actually want to keep control of the room (figuratively speaking) because your dominant Te and auxiliary Si is used to keeping things under control. Which is where I get similar to ESTJs to a degree. I can follow the rules, as long as they make logical sense to me.!&lt;

&gt;!But most forget that you have Ne tertiary, which can make you pretty chaotic, witty and funny, and are aspired by those who have higher Ne. And many forget that ESTJs (probably not those that spend their time on Reddit 24/7) can develop their Fi and, if well developed, are able to control their harsh personality.

To be exact, I don&amp;#39;t like the whole &amp;quot;ESTJs are bossy assholes&amp;quot; picture. Hanging with a few of them made me see for myself that they&amp;#39;re not really as bossy as that they actually want to keep control of the room (figuratively speaking) because your dominant Te and auxiliary Si is used to keeping things under control. Which is where I get similar to ESTJs to a degree. I can follow the rules, as long as they make logical sense to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;But most forget that you have Ne tertiary, which can make you pretty chaotic, witty and funny, and are aspired by those who have higher Ne. And many forget that ESTJs (probably not those that spend their time on Reddit 24/7) can develop their Fi and, if well developed, are able to control their harsh personality. My mom is an ESTJ by book, but she wouldn&amp;#39;t step over someone (unless she was given a damn good reason to) because for her, that&amp;#39;s a wrong thing to do in her heart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

My therapist told me ADHD is genetic and asked if one of my parents has it. I dont think my mom does but my dad has mentioned that he thinks he has it before. 

This doesn't make sense to me because he's literally always on top of everything in his life in addition to being on top of everything in our family's life (in a good way). Like he'll still send me reminders to do things because I mentioned it to him a while ago and he knows ill forget. Its one of the ways he shows he cares and we all love that about him and make sure he knows we appreciate him for it. Hes always organized, always does things IMMEDIATELY if they need to be done. He doesn't even wait a second to procrastinate anything. 

The only thing I can think of would be his tendency to lose control of his temper/emotions when he gets overwhelmed and feels like we arent listening to him or understanding or respecting him. Hell blow up and get overly emotional then feel bad afterward. I also have this tendency and know this can be common in individuals with ADHD. Maybe as an ESTJ, ADHD just manifests differently.

I know our types arent known to really get along or appreciate each other but I will always have a special place in my heart for you guys because I couldn't have asked for a better dad and being raised by an ESTJ has helped me recognize and develop my weaknesses as an ENTP.

# Hi ESTJs, I am an INFJ

I have been going thru a messy week and I am so stressed out about what is the reality now,

I had a group discussion with an INFP, an ESTJ and another un-typed person. We planed to film a video during the meeting but I misunderstood and was not mentally, physically and spiritually prepared for it. Before the meeting was a very long week and I had to travel 2 hours to get to meet them. Therefore I was stressed and appeared to be very disturbed. We argued and I admit I was wrong and I did pretty act up but I did not yell nor swear nor do anything (I think was) disrespectful.

The discussion was basically about them wanting to make 1 video at a time while I wanted to write the scripts of 10 videos and film all at once. I didn't feel heard at all cuz they had not known my ideas nor planned things out with me first but rather wanted me to do it right away. Eventually, they agreed to let me present my ideas.

When I was showing my ideas the INFP interrupted me by asking an irrelevant question (""How much GB is this laptop?"") so I got impatient and let them finish then asked them ""You done?""

They approved the ideas and I was required to produce a script immediately. I turned to ask the ESTJ to help me out with it cuz they was in charge of the content too. However,..

The ESTJ then said that I was vile, called me a child, a b\*tch and a b\*lly. He said I was being condescending in my tone of voice and that I ""vomit my emotions out"" without caring about others' emotions.

I ended up filming a video as they requested and asked the ESTJ if I could have used Teleprompter. He did not approve then I said ""I'm sorry but can we just try.."" He did not let me finish the sentence but told me that I did not listened to anyone and only did what I want. I was trying to be open to the possibilities and I do respect his opinion

We then had a discussion about what had happened but the ESTJ was still very aggressive and said he did not remember me saying ""I'm sorry but can we just try.."". I said sorry I made them feel that way and he said he did not forgive me but gave me a second chance.

The untyped person then said that I was being competitive and they assumed I was afraid of being not as good as the ESTJ when I told the ESTJ ""You are working too much."" What I really meant by that was because I felt sad he had to work too much for the team. It's all out of my compassion.

\_\_\_

What I feel after this is that it was my fault but what I am thinking is that was I really the bully and did I really make them feel bullied.

I feel so sad because my compassion for people is read wrong. In the meantime I truly don't want to cause people the feeling of being bullied.

,ESTJ,"I am not necessarily looking for a correlation to gender and femininity. Just curious to hear from other female ESTJ's.

As a kid I was always called a tomboy, playing videogames and playing soccer with the boys. In high school I was never occupied with make-up, latest trends, clothes or boys. In college I started being more feminine I guess, using make up and enjoy cute clothes. Now I am 28 and I am caring less about that stuff again. People have always told me I have very strong masculine energy. I feel like it's partly from my practical mindset. I see no point buying/putting on expensive make up just to go to work or to buy groceries. I only use make up on special occasions. I only know the very basics of make up, meaning I don't even know how to use eyeliner. I wear dresses more in spring/summer because  they're easy to wear and take off and it's just pretty (I like colorful clothes usually). I have never had my nails done nor gotten a beauty treatment or whatever.

The only time I notice I become a lot more girly is when I am talking to or dating a guy who has stronger masculine energy than me. Only happened once or twice in my life. And both times the guys were very surprised when I was e.g. putting on make up and wearing very girly clothes saying they never thought I could be that way. It was a nice surprise for them though.

I just feel like only people with a stronger, confident and more dominant energy can bring out this side in me. It also helps me figure out if the guy I am seeing is compatible or not with me since guys with a weaker masculine energy than me always end up annoying the fuck out of me and make me lose interest. I think in a way I just want to feel safe and taken care of with a romantic partner and that won't happen if I am the dominant one in my personal experience. Guys who had weaker energy than me always complained to me how I emasculated them and that I was too domineering and I should ""let"" them take the lead more which just makes me cringe.

Hallo cool and productive ESTJs! (and eventual other types)

Im doing some hobbiest research for a upcomming book based on LOTS of crossreffered interviews from EACH MBTI type about relationships related behaviours.

I have a standardized questioneer that one will have to answer in a honest way in a PM    setting. There are no wrong answers unless of cause they are dishonest.

I want it to happen in a private chat, since i prioitize a safe space for my questioneers to do the qustions in as high quality as possible. The questions will be about vulnerability, good and bad habbits, or if there has been any faul play inside a past relationship.

I allready have about 50 pages of more than 50 collected interviews but I will need a lot more, if one answers all the questions, one can eventually get my book when I eventually get done with it for free, or ask anything about ISTPs wich is a topic certainly within my expertise.

Im looking forward to collaberate with ye all, thank you for reading and considering helping me out!

**Deductive reasoning:**  

**1.** The ability to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense.   

**2.** An example of a deduction is Aristotelian syllogisms: *“All men are mortal. Plato is a man. Therefore, Plato is mortal.”*  

**3.** The reasoning flows in the direction of *simple to complex*. It mentally complicate the situation.  

**Inductive reasoning:**  

**1.** “The ability to combine pieces of information to form general rules or conclusions (*includes finding a relationship among seemingly unrelated events*).”  

**2.** Observing and comprehending complex phenomena, inductive thinking reduces them to generalized diagrams and models stripped of details. 

**3.** Inductive thinkers break down and simplify the situation in order to understand it. Reasoning flows in reverse order from *complex to simple*.

She's in her 50s and often talks about growing up and being ""like me"": In her room or to herself, and just doing whatever her parents threw her into. However, whenever her dad was being abusive to her, she'd ignore him for the day and it would work, even if his screams were deafening. If he was being abusive to her siblings, though, or if anyone else was in trouble, she'd call out the attacker's bullcrap, but with the mild temperament she had at the time.

Now life and trauma has significantly toughened her up, and she wishes to be less emotional when confronting issues she's really passionate about (she has quite a lot!), but it doesn't seem like neither of us really understand how she became who she is now.

If he was being abusive to her siblings, though, or if anyone else was in trouble, she&amp;#39;d call out the attacker&amp;#39;s bullcrap, but with the mild temperament she had at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now life and trauma has significantly toughened her up, and she wishes to be less emotional when confronting issues she&amp;#39;s really passionate about (she has quite a lot!), but it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like neither of us really understand how she became who she is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you guys kinda relate to this? How shy or mild were you when you were younger? If significantly so, what changed?&lt;/p&gt;

Few years back, I had INFP male as my boss and I am ESTJ female. I wasn't knew MBTI then and I'm sure he didn't knew either. He was unhealthy INFP as he was holding job position which was  not suitable for his personality. He was lead and supposed to be responsible for delivery and team management. He was unable to do so because he used to think a lot about future, he used to hate process and mended bended that numerous times. He used to be tactless while talking to people and even arrogant at times. He used to hate mundane tasks. He was extreme introvert. As result, he was quite unpopular and he was not giving damn to it anyway

On my part, looking at his behaviour, I assumed he has attitude issue. I stayed away from him, never opened up with him as i was seeing red flags in his behaviour. I am talking about pure work relationship, no romance involved. We worked together as parallel lines for couple of years. We never fought but never really impressed by each other either. However, projects we worked were success, may be because we were balancing it with our personalities unknowingly 

He always focused on multiple solutions etc where I used to be impatient if I don't complete day to day tasks. His expectations of me changed later, he kept on saying like give this mundane tasks to other juniors and make yourself free for next level but honestly, I never understood what he wanted to say then. I was immature ESTJ. 

Then came constant complaints about my work, which I was delivering perfectly fine. In short, he wanted me to use my Ne and Fi which was undeveloped then and he didn't knew it. We had this cold war for few months and situation degraded. Neither of us understood what is happening and we did  not do anything to resolve it

One day, he shouted on me on call. I felt so bad and hurt. I was tired of constant complaints about how I dont see all possible options for issue and use default solution etc. Next day, he may be realized that I did not like it and conveyed his apologies through other person. He mentioned he wants to talk through. I gave up by then mentally and got another job too, so I did not discussed it any further and simply changed job

Later sometime, after like year, I got to know MBTI and I was literally shocked to see that whatever he was saying was true. About Ne and Fi. I could understand he was INFP. It was like mystery resolved for me. Even if II didn't like his complaints about me, in a way  he is reason that I could improve myself for better. 

Since then, I had this eagerness to tell him all this, this might be funny.. this eager. I want to tell him badly that he is INFP. That will give him some peace for sure. He seems to be struggling with world and his role in general. But we are not in contact anymore and there is no way I will connect with him again.

I identify with everything of estj, except the empathetic/emotional component.

It usually doesnt matter if I think their emotions or outbursts are unnecessary/weird.

Some of you may remember that I posted a google forms link on this Subreddit, or if you're seeing this cross-posted from another Subreddit or on PDB, on a community there, for a survey about people's MBTI and Enneagram types. Well, I'm happy to say that the results are in with more than 1,000 responses. Here, I will rank the responses for each Enneagram type by MBTI type. Please remember that this is self-reported, and many of the respondents may be mistyped. And because this is only a small sample of the population, the law of large numbers says not to take this too seriously. Not to mention, the data points are rounded to the nearest tenth. This is entirely for fun and is to be taken with a grain of salt. Some of the results surprised me like the amount of ISTJ 9w1s, but I'm actually happy this surprised me, even though the results are iffy at best because so much is possible between the two systems. I will likely make another post soon with the results for each Enneagram type without wings in total and each MBTI type, but that is to be done at a later date.

Some of you may remember that I posted a google forms link on this Subreddit, or if you&amp;#39;re seeing this cross-posted from another Subreddit or on PDB, on a community there, for a survey about people&amp;#39;s MBTI and Enneagram types. Well, I&amp;#39;m happy to say that the results are in with more than 1,000 responses. Here, I will rank the responses for each Enneagram type by MBTI type. Please remember that this is self-reported, and many of the respondents may be mistyped. And because this is only a small sample of the population, the law of large numbers says not to take this too seriously. Not to mention, the data points are rounded to the nearest tenth. This is entirely for fun and is to be taken with a grain of salt. Some of the results surprised me like the amount of ISTJ 9w1s, but I&amp;#39;m actually happy this surprised me, even though the results are iffy at best because so much is possible between the two systems. I will likely make another post soon with the results for each Enneagram type without wings in total and each MBTI type, but that is to be done at a later date.

,ESTJ,"It seems to me that TJ type men might have difficulty with their 'care' response towards women. I would call this a 'protector' response

It seems like this type tends to freeze up or there is some issue with the fight or flight response. I am bringing this to the ES type subreddit because I believe intuitive-lean would create noise for this question and I trust E types are more likely to have a polished social response since they are more likely to interact with more people.

I am not hating on any type, simply trying to figure out if this is a TJ disconnect. If it is, how it might be solved, or even giving ideas through the examples

The examples I have for you to analyze

1. The man might not hug the woman when she is crying
2. The man doesn't believe the woman when she is in pain (even emergency-level pain)
3. The man doesn't show 'recognition' of an emergency, such as emoting surprise, He is perhaps slow to take action. For example: a paramedic is behind him and he doesn't move out of the way/react quickly, making him a liability in that moment
4. The man does not react to her requests to demonstrate protection: such as 'practice' emergencies or situations the woman fabricates to test his response ability. He doesn't understand that he needs to 'act out' his response and 'pretend' it is real. For example: She is worried about a suicidal friend and texts the man for advice, noting 'it is life or death' even though she knows the friend cries wolf a lot, it is still important to her that the man shows his response abilities. Again, there is a freeze-up or no response from the XXTJ man because perhaps he believes 'I am not there so I cannot stop the person from killing themselves fast enough for my response to matter at this moment' and so the man disregards himself as USELESS in the situation and by doing so actually PROVES hisself to be useless

So these are the only situations I can come up with so far but I have to say they are very off-putting, despite TJ types being known for making very good rational judgements...I can't help but feel responding to the emotional side in a timely and appropriate manner is also a part of being 'rational'?",t2_93agbhcr,False,,0,False,How can women help XXTJ type men with their 'care' response?,[],r/ESTJ,False,,,0,,False,t3_10x6atk,False,light,0.67,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question/Advice,False,2,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1675879718.0,text,,,,text,self.ESTJ,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that TJ type men might have difficulty with their &amp;#39;care&amp;#39; response towards women.

,ESTJ,"I enjoy working my boss. She is 20 years older and mentors me really well. But, I have a hard time managing her emotions of anger when she is frustrated at me for not being able to... think like her. I think my inferior Te has done a good job so far but with the ""mistakes"" I'm making, it seems that I just can't match up with the Te dom. 

I also feel overwhelmed when she corrects me in an angry tone. Whenever I try to clarify with her on the next step seems like I do not know my job well enough, or it makes her stressed as it means she isn't clear enough at giving instructions. And whenever I attempt to complete a task for the first time, I didn't meet her expectations of me as I was not thorough enough, which was expected of me as I have been observing how she manages the work processes (not the exact ones, yes I need to see the pattern). I feel trapped because I couldn't clarify neither am I allowed to make mistakes, its starting to feel a little like a straitjacket. I know I should have a better work ethic, I do want to improve.. 

Also knowing the political ground in the workplace makes me mentally overwhelmed, as there are people that my boss warns me about. 

Its difficult to come up with ideas and solutions while still feeling so overwhelmed with my boss' tendencies and the lack of social harmony in the workplace.

She is 20 years older and mentors me really well. But, I have a hard time managing her emotions of anger when she is frustrated at me for not being able to... think like her. I think my inferior Te has done a good job so far but with the &amp;quot;mistakes&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m making, it seems that I just can&amp;#39;t match up with the Te dom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also feel overwhelmed when she corrects me in an angry tone. Whenever I try to clarify with her on the next step seems like I do not know my job well enough, or it makes her stressed as it means she isn&amp;#39;t clear enough at giving instructions. And whenever I attempt to complete a task for the first time, I didn&amp;#39;t meet her expectations of me as I was not thorough enough, which was expected of me as I have been observing how she manages the work processes (not the exact ones, yes I need to see the pattern). I feel trapped because I couldn&amp;#39;t clarify neither am I allowed to make mistakes, its starting to feel a little like a straitjacket. I know I should have a better work ethic, I do want to improve.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also knowing the political ground in the workplace makes me mentally overwhelmed, as there are people that my boss warns me about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its difficult to come up with ideas and solutions while still feeling so overwhelmed with my boss&amp;#39; tendencies and the lack of social harmony in the workplace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I understand her better? Or be a better employee without getting stunned by her fiery spirit? Its hard for me to think when I just get headaches, as my emotions are on an overwhelm. How do I filter between my emotions and follow what needs to be done, effectively? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll go first. My plans have always been rather simple. I just want to have a lifelong partner, a soulmate. Preferably married. Own a cute little house with a few pets. Advance my social work career where I can work at a university or college with international students and exchange programs. Well, that or working part time at whatever job if my hubby would provide enough. I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind doing more housework to make up for that. I&amp;#39;ve never cared that much about my career path really. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children are something I&amp;#39;m not fixed on, I&amp;#39;d be happy with and without them. I&amp;#39;d also want to live comfortably enough to afford some luxuries I like such as travelling and tattoos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how about you guys?&lt;/p&gt;

,ESTJ,"I'm outgoing, friendly, and cheerful. I'm talkative and open. I get close to people easily and enjoy making friends. I've had friends in the past say I can be needy or not give them enough space, but it's because I love chatting with friends. At times, I'm not good at reading social cues. I vent a lot and ask for advice. I'm open about being angry or nervous. I don't talk as much about crying, but I still have cried on the phone with friends before. I can be generous by treating friends to fine dining (P.S. I love eating). I love gossiping about people and can be very sassy. I admit I can be judgmental about others, but I'm still really nice. I can get nosy about certain things with friends. Not about their whole life, but certain aspects of it.

I'm really hardworking. I'm like a workaholic with ambitions to be a top position at a top workplace. I'm a planner, efficient, competitive, and use a calendar. I plan things in advance and I'm always early. I make connections at work and take on a lot of tasks, so I'm a top performer. I write detailed notes down for every task in case I need to reference how to do something. With school, I also plan far in advance. I already made an organized list of every class I plan to take up until I graduate.

I have an assertive, leader personality. I take action for what I want and I'm not afraid to make a move on a guy first. Well, it can be a bit nerve-wracking. I still gain the courage to do it though. I can have trouble taking no for an answer because I really want what I want. I move quickly, but I can be fickle about who I like or what I want out of a relationship. Since I feel I'm a Type A woman, I'd also want a guy similar. I like confident, assertive, smart, nice, and cool men who are successful. I feel I come off intimidating to some of them. People say I give off business vibes and I grew up in wealth, so I'd like to find someone similar. I have high libido, so I like casual relationships too.

Some flaws I can work on are being insensitive, stubborn, temperamental, arrogant, confrontational, argumentative, passive-aggressive, and aggressive. I have confronted many classmates in the past and have been a snitch on several occasions. I get angry easily and thinking back on things that made me angry can just piss me off again. I like to roast others, but I can get defensive if I get roasted. During arguments, old friends have said I always think I'm right and refuse to see others' point of views. I can be impatient and inflexible. Often, I do want things to go my way, so I could work on this. I can also be sort of blunt or show off my wealth a bit too much at times. I'm a huge spender and I love the finer things in life along with the finer lifestyle. My friends have told me I have trouble admitting things that could hurt my ego. I'm not aware of it, but I guess that makes me prideful.

,ESTJ,"Hi all, 

I was wondering how you (estj) view/experience INTJ's (especially in the workplace)?

Context: 

*   Region: Scale-up environment in EU.
*   Manager - Employee Relationship

As an INTJ, I now experience for the 2° time in a row an ESTJ as my manager. I am working for a longer time at the company than them. But for the 2° time I don't have a good connection with them.. (Both times they have +-10y more work experience: ESTJ = 40y +) 

1. I wonder if this is just something in general between our types? :) 
2. I admire their dedication (work), planning/organising off teams/projects/targets skills.(manager skills).
3. But I can't seem to connect on the bouncing of ideas of strategy and the bigger picture, the disconnect of ESTJ focussing on details/get it done mindset vs INTJ want to focus/challenge the strategy of the way forward is just annoying as I don't think they really 'get' me or respect my ideas, I do see that they have their way/strategy..but are less open for discussion/challenge.. This all leads to me questioning their leadership skills and even thinking of switching employer as I don't want to be in the same position for the next 2y.. 
4. I am not sure how an ESTJ would respond to this honest feedback, and if it would just spiral back in a negative way for me..

,ESTJ,"Hey everyone! INFJ here. Hope you're all doing well.

I know ESTJs are a broad range of people so answers will differ, but I just thought I'd ask the general question and see what comes back.

E.g., there is unresolved conflict/tension in your family, and your family member proposes you and another family member try some family therapy.

- If your answer is yes, why?
- If no, also why? And what would help instead/what would you prefer? What kind of sell would get you to say yes?

I'm trying very hard to not be vague for you guys, so some context for you:

- Family dynamic: Boomer ISFJ mother, 30ish ESTJ elder daughter, late 20's INFJ younger daughter (it's a me)
- ISFJ mum and ESTJ sis have been at odds with each other since I can remember, but they always made up in the past.
- Their relationship has continued to get worse and worse, to quite bad, in the past 5 or so years. 

- Key communication issues are: 

- ESTJ sis very bad at reading feelings, intentions, emotional situations/environments and uses her internal logic based on incomplete/inaccurate data to make incorrect and often harsh judgements. When told these judgements don't include the full picture and miss the mark, refuses to budge/always needs to be right.

- ISFJ mum feels threatened when ESTJ questions her. ESTJ is trying to parse ISFJ's feelings and decisions through ESTJ's internal logic systems, which makes the ISFJ feel she's being disrespected and interrogated. ISFJ Shuts down as she doesn't feel psychologically safe. Escalates situations instead of de-escalating them, and when triggered can come across as (I hate to use this word but) neurotic, and passive aggressive.

I dont have the emotional energy to deal with it, but my hope is that if they went to family therapy:
- ESTJ would be more willing to listen to the advice of a third party with some authority who could guide her through putting herself in the shoes of others 
- ISFJ would feel that by having a third party there, they could guide her through verbalising her feelings and explaining her behaviours, so she could find more helpful tools to handle conflict and overwhelm.

May not be particular to type but just my family members, but I'm assuming their reactions would be:
- ESTJ: The ISFJ is wrong so why do we need to bother. There's nothing wrong with me and mum is just irrational. Might get some insights from therapy and then forget about it after a month or so.
- ISFJ: More willing to attend but unlikely she'd fully put her trust in the process, be resistant to opening up to a therapist, or actually putting into practice what they tell her to do outside of the therapist's office.

This is all probably TMI but I lurk here sometimes and assume you guys like to know why a question is being asked :)

,ESTJ,"Hey, good folks. I hope I'm not too annoying with my N or N-like way of being. I would hate to pressure anybody into reading a textwall, so please feel free to stop reading after the picture below, which is probably the most important part. The TL;DR is already contained in the title. Absolutely feel free to stop reading and ignore this if it gets too tedious while reading.

So, today, I took the Mistype Investigator's test and here's what I got:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2c8j5e9wcv5a1.png?width=1565&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=228112481b2b90658858a856c5efdf1a7018e115

A look at these is sufficient to tell why typing me is going to be a difficult task if not a fool's errand.

Out of these, TiNe or NeTi (as dom and aux) tends to be my consistent result, although in some tests under some theories Fi rears its head and flips me to F (e.g. Satinorva gave me INTP under a letter-based approach and INFP under its function-based approach). Fe being the lowest or second-lowest of them all also is a consistent trend. I get a huge variance in Te from one test to the text. Here, from Mistype Investigator, it was the highest and likely dom, while from Satinorva it got the lowest of all partial scores. In Michael Kaloz's test, I had a large Te, about 2/3 through, like here, but with a maxed-out Ti. Another consistent trend is for my Si and Se to place lowest and equal to each other.

When it comes to the type I get, as opposed to the raws, it's usually ENTP but very often INTP. In my early twenties (effectively extended teens, as I was more of an old adolescent than a young adult), I usually tested INTJ, though variance was high. In my early thirties I kept getting ENTP but fence-sitting on the E and the P in the letter-based approach, disregarding the functions. A month or so ago (closing in on my 40th birthday) I begin to get INTP from functions-based tests, with one INFP result.…

… And now this ESTP categorization despite my Ne being bigger — for lack of a better word due to me being a n00b — than my Si and Se, but my Si seems to be bigger than my Ni. Obviously, the differences among Fi, Ni and Se seem to be clearly within the margin of error, including the limits of hand-eye co-ordination when pushing the sliders (no steps, fluid scale), and even the Si is just &lt;2pp higher, so not the height of reliability.

For context, this seems to be consistent with my repeatedly balanced results in any kind of four-temperaments tests I take. I may be a balanced or undecided personality; adult ADHD may be a problem, as well as constantly living under a great deal of stress, so never in optimal conditions. Almost every type feels like a side of my personality when I read the descriptions, although not all in the same degree. Reading typical ENTP and INTP descriptions in particular feels like they describe two co-equal sides of me (like left lung and right lung), whereas some of the F or S types feels like something I might have developed into if I had been allowed to develop normally as a child, and like modes I can switch into. I can switch into INFP mode (negotiator/mediator), ENFJ mode (typical non-caster protagonist in RPG games), ESTP (smooth operator), ESTJ (executive), ENTJ (marshal on campaign), INTJ (mastermind planner), but it only feels like a 'mode'.

In Enneagram, I get a lot of variance, but high raw results in One, Eight and Nine tend to be common. I sometimes place 4w5 or 5w4 but often 1, 8 or 9w1. I'm obviously aware that a healthy Four will act like a healthy One and that a One may self-mistype as an Eight for the confidence boost.

My Gallup looks like this, and it seems to be consistent with NT:

However, I used to have great memory, such as remembering the regnal years for most of European monarchs, not needing a phone book, knowing the docket numbers of my cases and dates of hearings and rulings in them by heart, committing 9-digit phone numbers to memory without having to note them down (now I struggle with 6 digits), names, faces, recipes and more, although I'd never had photographic memory. I was also a conservative and a sort of upholder of traditional and community values, before the world around me transformed and moved away from those values. I can recognize inconsistencies and change. I like to be surrounded by data and munch on it. Although I like the intuitive stuff, I also like to learn how a device works by simply operating it, perhaps even stripping it apart to see how it works but not really, as I'm not technical, though I used to show a tendency in that direction. Another example is coffee machines — I'm drawn to the manually operated ones where you control the pressure, timing and everything else based on how it goes, muscle memory and muscle feedback, as opposed to playing with all the buttons and LED displays, automated settings, etc. Although I have a distaste of fixed procedures, that is generally due to the intellectual limitations in their design, not covering whatever they should cover, people trying to apply them too literally to 'hard cases' (which make for bad laws), so I prefer not to be bound by procedures or guidelines written by someone else if the job is to be done right on my watch and under my responsibility. I can be set in my ways, such as struggling to respond in real time to feedback received in real time, e.g. modify my behaviour if e.g. I spill water when watering a plant or pouring into a glass, I will often catch myself trying to brute-force it and of course failing, because how else, I should have known better. I'm also big on verifying traditions that don't check out (e.g. lower-order moral rules that are almost universally accepted by society but seem to be inconsistent with the higher-order moral rules professed by the same society; anything else that isn't fit for its intended purpose or doesn't comply with its professed values or otherwise fails the consistency/suitability test).

My professional life is generally a better indicator of anything close to natural or healthy than my private life, and it shows different tendencies. From Gallup's little business brother, the Builder BP10 test mostly intended for founders of startups (which I technically am but only because my freelance professional practice is technically a sole-prop, akin to a 100% owned small company), I got 1. Disruptor, 2. Knowledge, 3. Selling (charisma), 4. Independence, with a role classification of 'Expert' (rather than typical executive) and with the added proviso that my working style seems to emphasize a network of informal relationships with people. This all checks out remarkably, and I almost completely agree. I swim against the tide, despite being a conservative/traditional, I can't escape being knowledge-based (can't escape the 'sage/magician' archetype and couldn't possibly be a pure 'king' or 'warrior', forget 'lover'), I have strong charisma and selling skills, which I usually prefer not to use and have a complicated relationship with, and I usually operate independently (lone-wolf style) despite being collectively- and community-minded and loving the family, community and team vibes and always wanting to have multiple perspectives (considering them myself and sourcing them from others). And my way of dealing with 'matters' could resemble an ESTP at work (think Commissioner Selwyn Patterson hard at work). Informal, outside of formal procedures and official tracks, based on connections, stopping barely short of drawing an unfair advantage and committing an ethical violation in the dealing. Contracts settled on a handshake, oral agreements involving significant amounts of money, conversations off the record and without an e-mail trail, there is quite a lot of that.

I can grasp complex legal concepts and explain them simply. I can create my own too. I can reconstruct systems easily, distill rules from precedents, spot inconsistencies, but I'm neither as perceptive with regard to every little detail as a normal S person would be, nor the kind of abstract philosopher/scientist as one would expect an N person to be. I can handle philosophy when it comes my way, though I wouldn't normally chase it on my own initiative, let alone sit on my ass contemplating the meaning of the universe or the ideal form of government… unless I had a reason to; then I could plough through it like any other 10 people. But I'd rather be reading a historical novel or playing a role-playing game normally. I get along with philosophers and theorists, though I'm not one of them (except perhaps a theorist in my narrow Ph.D. field and a couple of other narrow fields, such as the teachings of my religion), and among normal people I'm too much of a philosopher and theorist. I suppose I'm too N for normal people (even pragmatic but not practical, by the normal person's standards; too detached, erratic, ditzy, not paying attention to mundane things, etc., though strangely aware of the surroundings) but too S for true, real Ns. This is similar to how I am too T for normal people but too F for hardcore intellectuals, hard scientists, forensics, etc.

I don't have the whole 'body' thing, my co-ordination is certified impaired (born two months preterm nad later 'cured' of left-handedness at the beginning of school education more than 30 years ago), I don't have balance (can't bike or skate), but I can be hypersensitive to sound or to the touch of rough materials on my (allergic) skin, and I appreciate the taste of good coffee, I like to cook, I'm super excited by photos of nature, and I like to watch travel docs, but it's like 'wow! this feels so good! I could do it all day!', except I actually end up doing it very rarely, similarly to how I enjoy 'Ultra HD' music and have invested a bit in the equipmen but end up listening to it only rarely for some reason. I've recently developed an obsession with maximizing the detail level in my computer games — ultra settings, even at the cost of low fps, just not to miss out on the eye candy. It's all erratic and just frankly messed up, much like my biography and whatever passes for my personality development. Again, in Enneagram, I sometimes get Four, i.e. the type of person who's searching for his own identity, and I can obviously see why, in more than one way, not that I meditate daily on it when I'm not in a rut.

I suppose in an ideal world and with most of my problems out of way, I could live the happy life a manager somewhere or owner-and-manager of some sort of small business or leader in an organization. The life of a generalist manager not too high up the chain, with the typical occupations and responsibilities of the position feels like an Utopia of peaceful life to me (inner peace, not like expecting there would be no conflict, of course). But perhaps circumstances have pushed me down the NT road, the lonely life of a freelance/expert that's consistent with some tendencies in my personality but perhaps not the life I desire or not the life I would be living in the ideal conditions. This is difficult to judge.

So… could someone with experience in this, e.g. someone who — in additon to oneself being a real ESTJ and knowing what that feels like, thinks like, acts like, speaks like, etc. — knows a lot about MBTI and/or someone who is an S long mistyped as an N, give me some pointers as to how to determine whether I'm N or S or sitting on the fence between the two?",t2_66ufdrvc,False,,0,False,So… I got an ESTJ result from Mistype Investigator after a lifetime of almost always testing as an N.

The TL;DR is already contained in the title. Absolutely feel free to stop reading and ignore this if it gets too tedious while reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, today, I took the Mistype Investigator&amp;#39;s test and here&amp;#39;s what I got:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/2c8j5e9wcv5a1.png?width=1565&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=228112481b2b90658858a856c5efdf1a7018e115""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/2c8j5e9wcv5a1.png?width=1565&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=228112481b2b90658858a856c5efdf1a7018e115&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A look at these is sufficient to tell why typing me is going to be a difficult task if not a fool&amp;#39;s errand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of these, TiNe or NeTi (as dom and aux) tends to be my consistent result, although in some tests under some theories Fi rears its head and flips me to F (e.g. Satinorva gave me INTP under a letter-based approach and INFP under its function-based approach). Fe being the lowest or second-lowest of them all also is a consistent trend. I get a huge variance in Te from one test to the text. Here, from Mistype Investigator, it was the highest and likely dom, while from Satinorva it got the lowest of all partial scores. In Michael Kaloz&amp;#39;s test, I had a large Te, about 2/3 through, like here, but with a maxed-out Ti. Another consistent trend is for my Si and Se to place lowest and equal to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the type I get, as opposed to the raws, it&amp;#39;s usually ENTP but very often INTP.

A month or so ago (closing in on my 40th birthday) I begin to get INTP from functions-based tests, with one INFP result.…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… And now this ESTP categorization despite my Ne being bigger — for lack of a better word due to me being a n00b — than my Si and Se, but my Si seems to be bigger than my Ni. Obviously, the differences among Fi, Ni and Se seem to be clearly within the margin of error, including the limits of hand-eye co-ordination when pushing the sliders (no steps, fluid scale), and even the Si is just &amp;lt;2pp higher, so not the height of reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context, this seems to be consistent with my repeatedly balanced results in any kind of four-temperaments tests I take.

&lt;p&gt;In Enneagram, I get a lot of variance, but high raw results in One, Eight and Nine tend to be common. I sometimes place 4w5 or 5w4 but often 1, 8 or 9w1. I&amp;#39;m obviously aware that a healthy Four will act like a healthy One and that a One may self-mistype as an Eight for the confidence boost.&lt;/p&gt;

,ESTJ," Hi, I'm writing a series analysing film characters who align with MBTI types. This post looks at the 2022 film ""Everything Everywhere all at Once"" starring Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn (ESTJ) and Ke Huy Quan as Waymond (INFP). It's a bit long but I hope this resonates with people, especially the ESTJs and INFPs out there.

Introduction

To re-describe the film in terms of the cognitive functions, Evelyn starts off with very poor usage of her Ter Ne and Inf Fi, and an inability to appreciate the Fi strengths of her INFP husband Waymond. Throughout the film, she learns to channel her comfort zone of Tertiary Extroverted Intuition (Ter Ne) in a healthier way, and she even plunges the depths into the darkest corner of her psyche (ESTJ sub-Ter Ni). With the knowledge and wisdom she has gained from exploring the other versions of herself across the multiverse, she learns to develop her Inf Fi and to appreciate her husband’s strengths, eventually using her weakness (Inf Fi) to save her relationships with her daughter and her husband.

Part 1: A Portrait of the Unhealthy ESTJ

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXT75VBulRI&amp;t=52s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXT75VBulRI&amp;t=52s)

The first thing we notice about Evelyn is her constant rush and hurry to get things done; there is a helter-skelter nature in her demeanour, overwhelmed with ever-lengthening lists of things ‘to do’, and each task must be done correctly. This is a manifestation of Evelyn’s Dominant Extroverted Thinking (Dom Te) and Tertiary Extroverted Intuition (Ter Ne) as an ESTJ.

[Extroverted Thinking (Te) is the objective judgement of quantifiable things](https://medium.com/@TypologyThoughts/the-cognitive-functions-part-1-of-2-defining-the-eight-building-blocks-of-the-human-psyche-d5efdcfb2188), meaning it focuses on completing measurable tasks efficiently. [Extroverted Intuition (Ne) is the objective perception of implications and possibilities.](https://medium.com/@TypologyThoughts/the-cognitive-functions-part-1-of-2-defining-the-eight-building-blocks-of-the-human-psyche-d5efdcfb2188) I’ve described it previously as a ‘squirrel spirit’, always darting to different items of interest. In an ENFP (Dom Ne, Aux Fi) or ESFJ (Dom Fe, Ter Ne), their powerful Ne is channeled towards unquantifiable, quirky and eclectic ideas and tastes due to the influence of Aux Fi and Dom Fe respectively. In Evelyn as an ESTJ however, this squirrel spirit is darting towards different tasks and responsibilities around her; from cooking enough noodles to painting wet spots to destroying googly eyes.

Evelyn’s concentration on the work of party preparations contrasts with Waymond who is much more interested in having a heartfelt conversation. Evelyn constantly ignores Waymond’s questions, treating them as irrelevant distractions. And yet Waymond (INFP Dom Fi) takes no offence and patiently focuses his efforts to make Evelyn feel valued. We will get more into Waymond’s perspective in Part 3.

When Evelyn sees Becky at 3:30, she makes no effort to express welcome, only frustration at the complications it brings to her party preparation efforts. The presence of Becky is understood by Evelyn as simply an additional mouth to feed for dinner, rather than the social and personal implication of her daughter bringing her partner to meet the parents. For Evelyn as a Dom Te, the situations she views through her Te lens are reduced into quantifiable tasks, with little concern for how Becky would react to being treated so coldly, or how Joy would be disappointed at her attempt to introduced her beloved to her parents. In the end at 3:53 it is Waymond who cheerfully welcomes Becky.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1wDm0w9uSQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1wDm0w9uSQ)

Evelyn is frustrated at Waymond for his “distracting” and playful nature. At the core of her frustration; she as a Dom Te sees the world through the lens of Te, and she sees Waymond’s Inf Te like a businessman looking at a child. She doesn’t recognise the ways in which Waymond (INFP Dom Fi) is far more mature than her (ESTJ Inf Fi) in matters of the heart. Hence, she infantalises him. She only sees through one lens (Te), and through that lens, she is the mature adult and Waymond is the immature child incapable of survival. She is not aware of the other lenses in which she is the child.

[The Dominant function is powerful, but because it is so ingrained in our psyche, it is almost unnoticeable, like how a fish would never notice water. ](https://medium.com/@TypologyThoughts/function-slots-and-their-characteristics-fc31e3b0fd2)We see that Evelyn suffers from this lack of awareness of her Dominant function. And as part of her journey of self-development, she would need to learn to see through other “lenses” to appreciate the strengths of others, see the weaknesses in herself, and improve on those weaknesses.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgIEcJaQo4E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgIEcJaQo4E)

This scene was quite painful to watch. We see how Evelyn’s ESTJ Inferior/Primitive Introverted Feeling (Inf Fi) utterly fails at connecting with her daughter. Evelyn’s Inf Fi is like a bull in a China shop, unwieldy and blunt, hurting instead of healing.

In the conversation with grandpa, Evelyn does the “practical” thing of brushing off Becky as a simple friend, even when it hurts Joy. And to compound the hurt, Evelyn then runs off as if there was some emergency or something important, only to merely beg an uninterested customer to come to their party. And for the icing on the cake, Evelyn senses that she needs to connect with her daughter but when the moment arrives, all she can mutter is blunt and hurtful words. You can see the regret on Evelyn’s face as Joy drives away.

These are perfect examples of how Evelyn’s ESTJ Inf Fi leads to a poor judgement of unquantifiable matters (feelings, values, interpersonal relationships). She becomes decisive in all the wrong ways, making terrible decisions when it comes to maintaining a happy relationship with her daughter. She keeps prioritising her laundromat and the rules of her household without understanding her daughter’s perspective. She may see Waymond as child when it comes to managing a business, but she herself is a child at managing interpersonal relationships.

In conclusion, the beginning scenes of this film illustrate Evelyn’s precarious situation. She is on the verge of losing her marriage and her daughter’s heart. I’ve seen this quote attributed to Jung, *“Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will rule your life and you will call it Fate”*, and while I’m not 100% sure of its source, it certainly applies to Evelyn’s situation. She sees herself as a superwoman holding the household together with her powers of organisation, but she does not recognise her Inferior/Primitive Introverted Feeling, and it seems to her that all her efforts at interpersonal relationships turn into ash despite her organisational strengths.

In the following parts, I will look into Evelyn’s journey into the darkest corner of the ESTJ (Part 2), Waymond’s perspective and the film’s healthy portrayal of Dom Fi in INFP men (Part 3), and round off Evelyn’s journey as she develops her Inf Fi as an ESTJ (Part 4).

&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To re-describe the film in terms of the cognitive functions, Evelyn starts off with very poor usage of her Ter Ne and Inf Fi, and an inability to appreciate the Fi strengths of her INFP husband Waymond.

I agree with that.\n\nBut in casual conversation I will say that you have only 4 functions and that’s enough.\n\nWhy?\n\n1. It’s pretty easy to misunderstand functions and think that all MBTI is fake, or that it means nothing.\n2. Shadow functions don’t affect our lives.\n3. Everything that’s going on in your life can be explained by 4 functions.\n4. It’s hard to type people by using 8 functions. It’s not effective.\n5. Really, you use confidently only 4 functions (sometimes we’re even bad at those).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEVERYONE DOES EVERYTHING\n\nEveryone does everything. What does that mean? It means that you won’t find anyone who would say: “No, I never use logic”; “No, I never think about values”; “No, I never organize my stuff”; “No, I never thought about the future”; “No, I never listen to anyone”.\n\nThere is extraverted Feeling (Fe) and introverted Feeling (Fi). They’re obviously both Feeling. They each love to feel. Fe won’t say: “I don’t have my own emotions”, and Fi won’t say: “I wish to destroy the harmony around me”. They aren’t different. They just use a different strategy to get the same result.\n\nTe and Ti, Fe and Fi, Ne and Ni, Se and Si aren't so different.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIT IS EASY TO MISUNDERSTAND COMBINATIONS OF THE FUNCTIONS AS OTHER FUNCTIONS\n\nWhen you talk with someone and think: “OMG! He listens. He cares emotionally about what I say. He’s for sure a Fe-user”. Then you find out he isn’t a Fe-user. You guess it was a shadow mode. It wasn’t a shadow mode. It was natural curiosity, Se, along with personal Fi-judgment, that in combination looks like Fe.\n\nNe-Ti can look like Te.\n\nNi-Te can look like Ti.\n\nWe need to discover the actual reason behind their actions.\n\nI am almost 100% sure that this misunderstanding is due to their Cognitive Function test. They come to you and say: “But my cognitive function results say that I use my Shadow”. And then you hear: “You need to include that in your theory. You need to update it according to the trend”.\n\nBut you don’t need to think about how it looks — you need to find the reason.\n\n\\[Yeah, let’s use Oi and throw away Oe!… I mean, we can’t allow any bad Oe here!\\]\n\nI took that same test, and it showed that my most powerful function is Ti, and maybe for some people Ni-Te looks like Ti.\n\nFor example, I create a particular system, and it works, and it helps, and it gives real results, everyone sees it, yet you come to me with: “Why?” — I’ll slap you in the face, so you could have a real example of my function at work! 😉 Well… er… I mean, don’t be surprised that I don’t prefer digging-for-god-knows-what Ti, but instead I prefer some extraverted signs of Thinking (Te).\n\nYou’d say: “But there were building-blocks of Ti in your test result”. Well, there is in reality no Ti there, only Te. Do you need the correct test or the correct result?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHERE IS SO MUCH MEANING IN EACH FUNCTION!\n\nWhy would you think that 4 functions aren’t sufficient to describe you well? One function, Ni, combines so much, that it almost completely understands us.\n\nI mean, why would you drop so fast into allegory (describing not that thing, but a thing that is like that thing)? Ni!\n\nWhy aren’t you paying attention to the road/conversation/current situation? Ni!\n\nWhy are you so into that one particular idea, and bothering everyone around with MBTI? Ni!\n\nWhy do you plan where to exit your hotel room in case of a fire? Ni!\n\nOut-of-control Ni wants to know what the food is like without even tasting it. What’s coming next? How can I prepare myself for more? It’s always MORE, MORE, MORE!\n\nNo! We don’t need more obsessive weirdos.\n\nPeople always try to help their Demons (2 lowest functions) by overworking their Saviors (top 2 functions). They always, by always I mean always, think: “If I use my Dominant function even more, then my Inferior function will take care of itself.”\n\nNo. How do you hope to develop your Se, if your Ni is on steroids, trying to control everything? How many hours per week do you really use your Se? Do you overprepare or actually can live in chaos of real world Se?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd all that info is combined in one Ni (without Se).\n\n\\[Btw, I found an example of overpreparing Thinker [https://youtu.be/eEsbsIbCCXs](https://youtu.be/eEsbsIbCCXs)\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIT’S EASIER, FASTER, AND MORE ACCURATE TO TYPE USING 4 FUNCTIONS\n\nMBTI says that you can’t rely on your shadow functions. You can’t use them without being fake. If you want to update that system, suggest something provable. Because I can explain all your shadow modes using the standard Cognitive function stack.\n\nIn reality, it’s way easier to type using 4 functions. I’m able to choose the top details from someone’s speech, and that would be enough to do typing. It’s fast and accurate, and it helps to clarify MBTI. While you with your 8-function model might say: “I still don’t know what their type is”.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWE CAN’T RELY ON SHADOW FUNCTIONS, BECAUSE SHADOWS ARE SUPER-EXHAUSTING\n\nDon’t get me wrong. It’s still quite interesting to see where you are strange, or how people with opposite functions act, or what we overlook all the time.\n\nI just found a nice example, where it can be a Shadow in me. \\[btw, you can join the contest\\]\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyINFJs/comments/xs6i7u/comment/iqqfchj/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyINFJs/comments/xs6i7u/comment/iqqfchj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n&gt;Well, if you won’t submit a design then you won't have a contest, right? (Te) 😊  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Just think, how do you want this sub to look? (Fi)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Inner voice 1: Bimep, this is not near the Fe-Ti! (looks like critic Ti)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Inner voice 2: So what?\n\nThat critic Ti always sounds like a grumpy old character, hated by everyone in the family, because he only likes to say: “This is bad. This is wrong. This is inaccurate” even if it has nothing to do with current work.\n\nBut anyway, only my normal Cognitive function stack can deal with that critic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nINFJs are Te-blind. It’s true. And they never seem to notice that.\n\nTime after time not noticing irritates others, and those others are like: “How is it that you couldn’t put those two ideas (two logic) together and compare them? You have a step-by-step method how to literally do that! Why da heck didn’t you do that — just because someone told you something?”. All the 7th functions are like so.\n\nWhat do INFJs have? They have Fe and they have Ti. INFJs are highly aware of the right word (Ni) that will play the best on your emotions (Fe), and all of that is built on hard, cold logic (Ti) and probably even has a sense of the real world (Se). They won’t manage the work, but they can manage the people who manage the work. INFJs use Fe+Ti, and it really gives them the result that they need, so why would they need Te?\n\nWhy are you trying so hard to get Te from them? It super-exhausts them. If you see an INFJ occasionally doing something with Te, you should be grateful and thank them for that. But if you expect that from them every day, you should realize that it’s not gonna happen. That would be the beginning of the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat’s the point in trying to get Fi from an ExTP? They think logically (Ti) and they care about you (Fe). Why would you want to overload them with Fi when they don’t even need it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy try to get Fe from IxTJ? They do something that works for you (Te) and it’s morally right (Fi), so that automatically makes it socially good (Fe).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, give them some slack, Shadow functions is not who they are. =)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks u/[JackieAutoimmuneINFJ](https://www.reddit.com/chat/channel/379698002_dc1568074cbe02b59c490c8ce1198cf8c7f15706) for styling the text =)"", 'author_fullname': 't2_s76efr8t', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Prove me wrong.

Then, I would love to hear how PTSD and Si are related for all types.  You do not need to share your personal experiences of what caused your PTSD, but I am curious how it may manifest differently for each type.  \n\n\nIntroverted Sensing (Si):\n\n* Homeostasis: Body Temperature, Hunger, Emotions, etc.\n* Fight, Flight, Freeze ***Response***: Goosebumps, Hair Standing on End, Racing Heart, etc. \\[Fight, flight, freeze ***decisions*** are made by introverted feeling (Fi)\\]\n* Long-Term Memory:\n   * Explicit Memory (actively recalled):\n      * Semantic Memory (details, data, dates, names, etc)\n      * Episodic Memory (past personal experiences)\n   * Implicit Memory (passively recalled):\n      * Procedural Skills &amp; Habits (Muscle Memory)\n      * **Respondent (Classical) Conditioning (Think Pavlov)**\n      * Non-Associative (Habituation) Learning\n      * Priming\n* Bonds/Loyalty: Lasting Impressions &amp; Imprinting, Attachments (Spiritual Cords) **(This can also be negative impressions from trauma/abuse resulting in PTSD where a piece of you is trapped in the past and when that memory gets triggered you are reliving a past event rather than truly perceiving what is happening in that very moment.**\n* Consistency: Routines &amp; Traditions\n* Time Period - Past: What happened before?\n\nPTSD is usually triggered by extraverted sensing (Se) as the sensing functions are on an axis with each other.  These triggers can be a word/phrase, a sound, a smell, a touch, a taste, etc.  Usually it hits one of your 5 senses that then triggers a memory pulling you back into a state of mind when the trauma occurred and thus, you are no longer truly experiencing the moment, but sort of reliving the past.  This type of memory recall is an implicit memory that is passively recalled.  For example, many soldiers with PTSD from war really struggle with fireworks or when a car backfires and they are literally thrown back into being on the battlefield inside their mind.  This is an extreme form where you are literally seeing the battlefield and the other soldiers...it's a hallucination where the memory is projected out into reality.  PTSD does not need to be this extreme.  You may just relive the feeling and get hostile, angry, irritated, or annoyed by something completely innocent.    \n\n\nThese triggers do not need to be logically connected and most are not.  It's a form of classical conditional where an unrelated item triggers a response in someone.  If you take Pavlov's dog who heard a bell and was then given food.  After x amount of times, just by hearing the bell the dog would salivate expecting food even before it was given.  It is the same thing for PTSD, but in a negative response.  Say Pavlov rang the bell and then placed a stick in front of the dog.  At first he may throw the stick to play fetch and the dog would form a bond or an attachment to Pavlov (think of this like love bombing).  But then instead of throwing the stick, Pavlov starting hitting the dog with the stick.  At first when he heard the bell, he would get excited to play.  But after being struck with the stick, now he is hesitant with the bell.  After enough times, the dog would cower in fear and pain or lash out and try to bite Pavlov just by hearing the bell.  This is PTSD as a result of conditioning.  If an experience is traumatic enough (which is very subjective) you do not need to experience an event multiple times for it to result in PTSD.    \n\n\nIn order to heal from PTSD, you must learn what your triggers are and disconnect the unrelated item from the traumatic event.  That way when you see a random stick or hear a firework explode, you are not thrown back into the past.  \n\n\nI'm working on a YouTube video about this very topic, but would like to hear input from all personality types on how they experience PTSD and how they have recovered from PTSD.  It could also just be how you experience being triggered and if you can recognize it when it is happening or not.  \n\n\nThanks!"", 'author_fullname': 't2_fp4vfoup', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'PTSD &amp; Introverted Sensing (Si) [Trigger Warning]', 'link_flair_richtext': [{'e': 'text', 't': 'Theory Discussion'}], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/mbti', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': '', 'downs': 0, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_yry7z0', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 0.89, 'author_flair_background_color': '#73ad34', 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 20, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': '4584fa56-4607-11e6-ab65-0e724eed375d', 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'Theory Discussion', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 20, 'approved_by': None, 'is_created_from_ads_ui': False, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': 'infj', 'author_flair_richtext': [{'e': 'text', 't': 'INFJ'}], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1668131877.0, 'link_flair_type': 'richtext', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'richtext', 'domain': 'self.mbti', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, I&amp;#39;d like to share my explanation of Si as it may be different from what you think.

* worked directly as staff and directing roles in bars and restaurants, 
* have been studying and practicing as an architect / building engineer and manager for quite some time. both in organisations as self-directing. 

All these functions and roles have a big role for ""fixing stuff¨. like a to do list to just make that drawing,  keep that customer happy, fix all the 500 foreseeable and unforeseeable aspects in both preparation and execution of a wedding as the location host., never stressful, but ""in the flow""  All this with a big role to do it as efficiently as possible. certain aspects have a decisive aspect on the whole, like costs, contentment of stakeholders like customers and employees and myself, quality, time. etc. That is kind of how my head works, pretty consciously even because I'm not an ESTJ, most of the time in these kind of situations. 

Now here is the thing, I like it, I use these skills in many other situations as well, but it never feels ""intrinsic"".

at my best, it gives me so much energy to do this stuff that the activity itself is (more than) the reward. I am like a machine that can keep going on the good vibes that I create by ""just doing stuff""

,ESTJ,"The other kind of mental process identified by Jung is judgment, a process of organising and evaluating information, and coming to conclusions. Using the judging process, some sort of evaluation is made and Jung identified two kinds of judgment: Thinking and Feeling. The T-F dichotomy is our ‘output’ scale - ie how we each make decisions.

Both of these can be used in either the outer, extraverted world or in the inner, introverted world. Thinking judgments are based on objective criteria or principles, as Jung describes:

*...judgement is reserved as to what significance should be attached to the facts in question. And on this significance will depend the way in which the individual deals with the facts.*

Feeling judgments are based on personal, interpersonal, or emotional values as Jung describes:

*...adaptation will depend entirely on the feeling value he attributes to them.*

Thinking types tend to make their decisions based on data, evidence and rational thought. They tend to be pragmatic and not swayed by antipathies or emotions but prefer empirical data.

,ESTJ,"We all hate reading walls of text, so I'll keep it short. I used to be able to easily cry whenever I felt upset/sad/whatever. I'd cry in private, never in front of anyone. As I got older, I noticed I cried less and less, thinking that's part of growing up too and having been gone to therapy for childhood trauma. Healed from the worst shit from my past, but some things still linger but not as bad. I am no longer depressed.

But I noticed since the last month or so, I have literally unable to cry. I feel pent up emotions, they're clearly there. And some shit happened lately and I haven't really been happy for a few months for several reasons. And whenever I feel like I am about to cry, I just don't. And I never had this issue before. It's like I cannot release/express myself, well my negative emotions. I feel kind of hollow, empty,... Like I have nothing left in me anymore to pour out. I just feel like ""crying won't change shit"" and just accept whatever happens in my life. But it also makes me feel shit but even when I want to cry, nothing happens. I feel it coming up but right when the tears should roll down, they just don't.

Anyone else been through something like this? I've always been shit expressing my feelings to others but I have gotten a lot better at it.

It is automatically good. \\[In fact, it would be nice to put some kind of brakes on it!\\]\n\n*Auxiliary* is also very powerful.\n\n*Tertiary* — could be better, but still works pretty well.\n\n*Inferior* — usually we don\'t load this function properly, so we have a problem in our life because of that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecond and third functions work in balance about 60/40. They’re pretty even.\n\nFirst and fourth are used about 90/10. You see? Fourth is used only about 10% of the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when you’re typing someone, you look for that disproportion.\n\nYou look to see if the person is crazy\n\n1. about **info/things** (constantly missing the information, “control” vs “chaos” SN) or\n2. about **people** (constant problems with people, “me” vs. “tribe” TF).\n\nChoose your crazy group. =)\n\nThen you check to see if the person is a Jumper \\[see the Dictionary [https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyINFJs/comments/xq5i6p/dictionary\\_if\\_you\\_struggle\\_with\\_understanding\\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyINFJs/comments/xq5i6p/dictionary_if_you_struggle_with_understanding_an/) \\].\n\nAfter that you play with functions: Ni or Ne, Fi or Ti, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is OP based stuff. I crossposted it before [https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyINFJs/comments/xanui6/observers\\_and\\_deciders/](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyINFJs/comments/xanui6/observers_and_deciders/)\n\nSo now I’ll just repeat all of that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can’t type based on: “I do this, and I do that”. Of course, everybody does everything. Notice where someone actually spends the most of their time.\n\nTheir imbalance between Dominant and Inferior function will be so big, that it isn’t just: “This is a problem”, but it will be: “OMG! This is a catastrophe! Now I’m dead!”. Most of their energy will be spent here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# OBSERVERS\n\nObservers (ExxP and IxxJ) feel trapped in a recurring Magic show: ""Where did it disappear to?""; “When I bought that car, I thought it had X, but now I see it doesn’t.”; “Oh! I thought there were mushrooms in the back yard, but now I see that those are just leaves that look like mushrooms.”; “Where did I put that?”; “I lost my key!”; “What does that mean? What’s the hidden meaning behind that?”; “I don’t see it.”; “I don’t understand that, so it can’t be real.”; “Illuminati are after me!” Observers live in Jumanji.\n\n— they ask someone\'s name and forget it the next second,\n\n— they easily get bored,\n\n— when you take their stuff, it’s like you took their soul,\n\n— they are triggered if something like the printer doesn’t work.\n\nAll of that means that they’re perceiving only half of all the information. (Did you catch what I’m saying here, or were you zoned out? 😉)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir mindset is, “*The rarest thing in the world is information*.”\n\nJust literally yesterday Jackie told me, “Noticing is 90% of wisdom.” As if quoted just out of a book, haha. Why 90%? Why info? It’s not about thinking and logic, it’s about noticing.\n\nObservers are pretty balanced with T and F. Do you know where they shine? In finding the compromise, because they look at a problem with their eyes and through the eyes of another human. They have that continuous dialog in their head.\n\nObservers love to argue about politics. They will gladly go on a rant about government, because it’s fun for them. Because it’s about people, and they’re not the least bit afraid of people.\n\nThey can say “F you” and don’t get upset about that, because they realize they know where to stop, and they are sure in that skill. Like, “Do you want to wish Happy Birthday to your grandma?” — “Yeah. Grandma, you have 4 months to live.”\n\nWhen Observers tell a story, people descriptions are usually vague. The characters are like blurry figures, like “some guy” or “that was XXXX” and that’s it. Who cares about people? Observers are busy processing if they’re on the right path or the wrong one. “Is this the right path? Is this real?”\n\nPeople can often be a problem for Observers, but not too much: “Eh, it is hard, but I can deal with that.” It’s not the end of their life!\n\nBut why are they angry at people? Because the people didn’t give the Observer enough info: ""You didn\'t tell me!"" Also, when you argue with them, they don’t need your amazing logic, it’s 99% that they need to understand if your view is real.\n\nObservers are obsessed with telling the truth: “I’m young, but I won’t keep silent. I see what’s going on. I’m telling you the truth, and you will listen to me!” And when you listen to them, it feels like you made a deal with someone who does monster drugs.\n\nYou might even know them for 20 years, and in those 20 years the biggest thing for them is sending you links with the text: “Look.” \\[Like I do all the time)\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, Observers finally come up with *the secret missing information:* “You should greatly value the treasure of observation and discovery. If you don’t, then probably it’s because of being in the wrong environment, like when you’re not allowed to ask questions. \\[If you ask them, they’ll say that they’re angry because of people, but not things!\\] Observers think: “Everybody’s too cool! Everybody wants you to think they know something. But they don’t!” \\[They aren’t afraid of people, they really want to interact with people to get their information.\\] “Everything that people propose is search and find. So you should value your ability to do that!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# DECIDERS\n\nDeciders (ExxJ or IxxP) of course would be offended because someone stole their phone! Yes, it’s also a problem for them, but the disaster won’t be so huge as for Observers. Problems for the Deciders are people.\n\nThose who often screw up with people think: ""I\'d better spend extra time learning by myself, doing my own research, so I don’t need to ask anyone else for what I need.”\n\nIf they argue about something, in the end it’ll always will be about someone else: “This is because of Timmy! This is his fault!” Even if you have no idea who Timmy is, Deciders have a need to talk about him.\n\nIf you have a conversation about politics or something similar, they will be: “Please, don’t talk to that person. Please, leave him alone.”\n\nEverything is because of people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDeciders have big swings between, ""Who am I? What do I want?” and “Do people like what I do? Does it work for them?”. Observers in this regard move as on a superhighway. They have several lanes where they can switch, but they don’t wander off the road. On the other hand, Deciders move deliberately down the center, and if they deviate, that pushes them too far — “Nobody loves me, nobody needs me. Everyone around me is bad"" or ""I\'m a piece of \\*\\*\\*”.\n\nThese are also called Single Deciders, because they decide something once and don’t reconsider it ever: “Done! This is what I said. That’s my final word.” Their decision is an infinity thing, otherwise there is a darkness for them. They are super-terrified to be wrong, or to have been lied to. They cope this way: “I don’t want to be cut off, so I will forever say that this is bullshit or fake news.” It’s very hard to change their point of view.\n\nDeciders are also weird when they find that everybody else in the world are assholes, but some people are sweet. Deciders say: “I thought you were XXXX, I saw XXXX, you acted like XXXX, but you make me feel you’re human. Only your few close people know that you’re not XXXX, but human.” Observers will be like: “Eh, yeah, of course. It’s obvious, so let’s get back to information!”, but for this Decider it’s really about the discovery.\n\nHere’s an author’s example of discovery: “One of the most important lessons I’ve learned about sales is that you meet the customers where they are, not where you are. If I think my book is great, I can walk around the whole day saying, \\`This is the best book ever!’ But, if I don’t consider my readers — what they think, what they feel — and if I don’t ask myself what is good for them and what works for them, I’ll end up with a book that only I like and nobody else does.\n\nAlso, I found there are different types of criticism: helpful educational criticism, thoughtful and kind criticism, and just plain old criticism when people just want to bang their keyboard. At first, it’s actually painful to hear criticism. But being all online, having your life visible, you have to be a little skeptical about anything that’s said about you. Reading all the compliments it’s easy to believe: “Oh, that’s me. I’m cool!”, but remember — it’s possibly not even true. Yes, I want to hear helpful criticism. Yes, I want to hear the validation, but I also want a certain amount of kind thoughtfulness.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe whole story of human life is about finding the connection between the first and fourth functions. When they do find that connection, they become famous. Why? Because most people aren’t good in their 4th function, because it’s such a struggle to learn how to use it. We don’t go to Ni-doms to ask about using Ni because they don’t think about it — they simply use it automatically. So we go to Se-doms who developed their Ni, because they really know how it works. They fought for that. They went through hell to reach that.\n\nNo one is as generous as ExTJ (there is even a saying ""royal gesture"")\n\nNo one is as smart as ExFJ\n\nNo one is as perceptive as ESxP\n\nNo one is as organized as ENxP\n\nNo one is as creative as ISxJ (for real, look at r/ISTJ! They were tasked with making a creative avatar, so they screened it up and put it on as their avatar. It\'s the most creative thing I\'ve seen!)\n\nNo one is as brave as INxJ\n\nNo one is as caring as IxTP\n\nNo one can run a business as well as IxFP\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what is your story?

Because the people didn’t give the Observer enough info: &amp;quot;You didn&amp;#39;t tell me!&amp;quot; Also, when you argue with them, they don’t need your amazing logic, it’s 99% that they need to understand if your view is real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Observers are obsessed with telling the truth: “I’m young, but I won’t keep silent. I see what’s going on. I’m telling you the truth, and you will listen to me!” And when you listen to them, it feels like you made a deal with someone who does monster drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might even know them for 20 years, and in those 20 years the biggest thing for them is sending you links with the text: “Look.” [Like I do all the time)]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the end, Observers finally come up with &lt;em&gt;the secret missing information:&lt;/em&gt; “You should greatly value the treasure of observation and discovery. If you don’t, then probably it’s because of being in the wrong environment, like when you’re not allowed to ask questions. [If you ask them, they’ll say that they’re angry because of people, but not things!] Observers think: “Everybody’s too cool! Everybody wants you to think they know something. But they don’t!” [They aren’t afraid of people, they really want to interact with people to get their information.] “Everything that people propose is search and find. So you should value your ability to do that!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;DECIDERS&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deciders (ExxJ or IxxP) of course would be offended because someone stole their phone! Yes, it’s also a problem for them, but the disaster won’t be so huge as for Observers. Problems for the Deciders are people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those who often screw up with people think: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d better spend extra time learning by myself, doing my own research, so I don’t need to ask anyone else for what I need.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they argue about something, in the end it’ll always will be about someone else: “This is because of Timmy! This is his fault!” Even if you have no idea who Timmy is, Deciders have a need to talk about him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have a conversation about politics or something similar, they will be: “Please, don’t talk to that person. Please, leave him alone.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything is because of people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deciders have big swings between, &amp;quot;Who am I? What do I want?” and “Do people like what I do? Does it work for them?”. Observers in this regard move as on a superhighway. They have several lanes where they can switch, but they don’t wander off the road. On the other hand, Deciders move deliberately down the center, and if they deviate, that pushes them too far — “Nobody loves me, nobody needs me. Everyone around me is bad&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a piece of ***”.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are also called Single Deciders, because they decide something once and don’t reconsider it ever: “Done! This is what I said. That’s my final word.” Their decision is an infinity thing, otherwise there is a darkness for them. They are super-terrified to be wrong, or to have been lied to. They cope this way: “I don’t want to be cut off, so I will forever say that this is bullshit or fake news.” It’s very hard to change their point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deciders are also weird when they find that everybody else in the world are assholes, but some people are sweet. Deciders say: “I thought you were XXXX, I saw XXXX, you acted like XXXX, but you make me feel you’re human. Only your few close people know that you’re not XXXX, but human.” Observers will be like: “Eh, yeah, of course. It’s obvious, so let’s get back to information!”, but for this Decider it’s really about the discovery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here’s an author’s example of discovery: “One of the most important lessons I’ve learned about sales is that you meet the customers where they are, not where you are. If I think my book is great, I can walk around the whole day saying, `This is the best book ever!’ But, if I don’t consider my readers — what they think, what they feel — and if I don’t ask myself what is good for them and what works for them, I’ll end up with a book that only I like and nobody else does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I found there are different types of criticism: helpful educational criticism, thoughtful and kind criticism, and just plain old criticism when people just want to bang their keyboard. At first, it’s actually painful to hear criticism. But being all online, having your life visible, you have to be a little skeptical about anything that’s said about you. Reading all the compliments it’s easy to believe: “Oh, that’s me. I’m cool!”, but remember — it’s possibly not even true. Yes, I want to hear helpful criticism. Yes, I want to hear the validation, but I also want a certain amount of kind thoughtfulness.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole story of human life is about finding the connection between the first and fourth functions. When they do find that connection, they become famous. Why? Because most people aren’t good in their 4th function, because it’s such a struggle to learn how to use it. We don’t go to Ni-doms to ask about using Ni because they don’t think about it — they simply use it automatically. So we go to Se-doms who developed their Ni, because they really know how it works. They fought for that. They went through hell to reach that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one is as generous as ExTJ (there is even a saying &amp;quot;royal gesture&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one is as smart as ExFJ&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one is as perceptive as ESxP&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one is as organized as ENxP&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one is as creative as ISxJ (for real, look at &lt;a href=""/r/ISTJ""&gt;r/ISTJ&lt;/a&gt;! They were tasked with making a creative avatar, so they screened it up and put it on as their avatar. It&amp;#39;s the most creative thing I&amp;#39;ve seen!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one is as brave as INxJ&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one is as caring as IxTP&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one can run a business as well as IxFP&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what is your story?

,ESTJ,"First of all just let me say that this isn't in the near future, it's just an idea that I have and I need a business plan for my second to last week at college (16 months from now).

I have some basic ideas but I'd like to fine tune them and ace this project when it comes up. I want to be prepared.

Right now I'm looking at menu ideas, recipes and food handling guidelines. The technical side is just as important.

The first item will be the menu, since this is a plan for a brick and mortar bakery I'm looking at specialty cakes; birthdays, weddings, anniversaries etc. Cupcakes, donuts, different varieties of bread; apple cinnamon, banana, chocolate etc. Cookies, and I'm planning on buying bulk French pastries to bake and resell. The first thing I'll need is a website for my business that includes the menu items, I'm also thinking of getting a rough draft of an in-house menu design, how descriptive do  want the individual items to be, how much will they cost with all my expenses? How will I turn a profit? Things of that nature.

As far as recipes go, I'm planning on using some recipes I found on YouTube and tweaking them a bit to make them my own. Think like a chewier cookie or a softer muffin. I also plan on practicing and experimenting with the ingredients to get different textures, chew, crisp and sweetness in my own personal kitchen.

As for food safety, permits and licensing goes I'm planning on having proper food handling instructions available at every work station as well as reminders to wash hands. I'll need at least 6 bakers; 3 morning, 3 evening, 6 cashiers (more as the company expands), 4 dish washers, 2 greeters and 8-12 servers, as we'll as 4 managers and 6 shift leaders.. Each employee will undergo food handling training as well as maintaining a safe work environment. As for permits and licenses, I need a business license ($100-250), an Employer Identification Number (free), resale permit ($0-50), food handlers permit ($5-30), Building Health Permit ($50-1,000), Dumpster Placement Permit ($10-100/week), food service license ($100-1,000), sign permit ($20-50), certificate of occupancy ($100). [$2,830 start-up cost]

For advertising we will use all forms of social media as well as operating at local farmers markets and renting tables, where we will sell and offer free samples of our products. We will also offer tote bags, t-shirts and hats with our company logo to get free advertisements.

That's my proposal for the moment, remember this isn't something that's going to happen over night. This is just a rough draft and I would appreciate any advise you'd be willing to share.

&lt;p&gt;The first item will be the menu, since this is a plan for a brick and mortar bakery I&amp;#39;m looking at specialty cakes; birthdays, weddings, anniversaries etc. Cupcakes, donuts, different varieties of bread; apple cinnamon, banana, chocolate etc. Cookies, and I&amp;#39;m planning on buying bulk French pastries to bake and resell. The first thing I&amp;#39;ll need is a website for my business that includes the menu items, I&amp;#39;m also thinking of getting a rough draft of an in-house menu design, how descriptive do  want the individual items to be, how much will they cost with all my expenses? How will I turn a profit? Things of that nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as recipes go, I&amp;#39;m planning on using some recipes I found on YouTube and tweaking them a bit to make them my own. Think like a chewier cookie or a softer muffin. I also plan on practicing and experimenting with the ingredients to get different textures, chew, crisp and sweetness in my own personal kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for food safety, permits and licensing goes I&amp;#39;m planning on having proper food handling instructions available at every work station as well as reminders to wash hands. I&amp;#39;ll need at least 6 bakers; 3 morning, 3 evening, 6 cashiers (more as the company expands), 4 dish washers, 2 greeters and 8-12 servers, as we&amp;#39;ll as 4 managers and 6 shift leaders.. Each employee will undergo food handling training as well as maintaining a safe work environment. As for permits and licenses, I need a business license ($100-250), an Employer Identification Number (free), resale permit ($0-50), food handlers permit ($5-30), Building Health Permit ($50-1,000), Dumpster Placement Permit ($10-100/week), food service license ($100-1,000), sign permit ($20-50), certificate of occupancy ($100). [$2,830 start-up cost]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For advertising we will use all forms of social media as well as operating at local farmers markets and renting tables, where we will sell and offer free samples of our products. We will also offer tote bags, t-shirts and hats with our company logo to get free advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s my proposal for the moment, remember this isn&amp;#39;t something that&amp;#39;s going to happen over night. This is just a rough draft and I would appreciate any advise you&amp;#39;d be willing to share. I just want to knock this out of the park!&lt;/p&gt;

,ESTJ,"Just wondering about this. When I was younger and in all my previous relationships, I put feelings/emotions over logic. I'd date some random losers while I objectively realised the big red flags from day one but ignored them in favor of my feelings for them. Funnily enough I was always the one dumping all my exes due to a lot of ""logical"" reasons. Stuff like partners who refused to get a job, didn't help with the chores, couldn't make phone calls for e.g. dentists appointments because they were too ""scared"" to do it, etc... I mostly had indecisive partners too who didn't really know what they were doing in life and that really bothered me. Most relationships I had lasted 3-6 months. No real long term relationship. I ended them because I just got too pissed off and impatient with their overall incompetence at the most basic adult tasks in life.

Now I am 28 and I feel like I properly see the aforementioned red flags way better and actually don't date purely out of feelings anymore. I've rejected 3 guys who asked me out on a date this year alone while I would have given such people a chance in the past. I just immediately scan for stuff like ""do they have a stable job and income? What do they do? Can they cook/clean?"" etc... I think a lot more practical when I consider seeing/dating someone and if they do not check a certain amount of boxes I have in mind, I don't even give them a chance.

A lot of people say that is not ""very romantic"". Despite this, I am still extremely romantic when I'm actually in a relationship, super loving and caressing. I just feel smarter in a way when it comes to dating and don't date men who clearly have heavy issues or big red flags anymore. I want a partner who helps lift me up instead of someone dragging me down. I used to exclusively date ""broken men"" on top of everything else, so yeah. I feel so much happier since I've stopped doing that.

,ESTJ,"You are the director of several companies. You have a manager directly under you and an assistant manager managed by your manager and you. You are overseas and not able to be at office and on top of things due to COVID situation, you have frequent contact with your manager and you catch-up with your manager and assistant manager weekly. You do the manager's appraisal and your manager does the assistant manager's. Therefore, you don't really work closely with the assistant manager and most info you get about the assistant manager is only from your manager.

One day, the assistant manager requests a call with you in private, without the manager.

,ESTJ," Hey guys!

Out of curiosity I am doing a poll on the drug preferences of the different MBTI personality types. I couldn't really find a proper poll or study on this topic with numbers so I'm doing it myself. This poll doesn't take much time so I would be happy if you would answer it ;)

You can participate, if you think this poll would yield interesting results and you have experience with different substances.

If you are morally opposed to the consumption of drugs (legal or non-legal), please do **NOT** participate and manipulate the results.

In case that I actually get enough data to make a propper graph/table/etc. I will post it on [r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/) and update it, if needed.

The poll will be anonymous and I will be the only person that will be reviewing the answers.

,ESTJ,"Just a random question that popped up in my head. I used to have really bad attachment issues. I'd be 'friends with everyone' usually or very easily. And I was always dating, seeing, sleeping,... with a guy. I went into therapy in my early 20s and worked trough a lot of my traumatic upbringing. Then also spent years on my own training myself in a way to be aware of my issues and get better. All in all I think I spent almost a decade working on myself after I became suicidal at 15 (never tried anything, mostly non-stop intrusive thoughts).

I am 28 now and recently went to therapy again. Not for issues but because I thought maybe it could help improve myself overall again. But after 5-6 months they already said I don't have to come anymore as I seem to really have my life and myself together and I have no big issues left anymore. And for the first time in my life am I not trying hard to date, fuck, see or even like a guy anymore. This used to be a constant obsession of mine, or rather a distraction from my problems. I always NEEDED someone to daydream about every single day. And this is the first time I don't feel that as a ""need"" anymore and I am just happy as I am, a single pringle. And I genuinely don't mind being alone. Having or not having a partner doesn't determine my happiness or self worth anymore.

I was wondering if any other ESTJ's have or had attachment issues. I think it is kind of funny as people see us as stoic and cold, distant people. But the way I used to get unhealthily attached to people is the complete opposite, I'd be extremely involved and very warm and sweet (still am to loved ones).

We know we can count on our Saviors, because we know how well we can use them. We also know we will be successful because leaning on them doesn’t exhaust us. It’s even fun sometimes to show off our dominant function. Why can’t other people do that too?\n\n**Demons (3rd and 4th functions)**\n\nWhen we talk about something that requires our Tertiary and/or Inferior function, we’re talking about SERIOUS topics. (\\*We don’t ban anyone for addressing serious issues here, but if you’re in your Demons, at least try not to sound crabby or condescending\\*). This is hard, we know that, and we recognize that we are bad at that, because it takes real effort to confront our Demons. When we see that other people are good at our Demons, we feel insecure. For example, my Inferior function is Se. I don\'t like it, but I see that other people use it well. They’re good at Se, and I know that I’m bad at that. Other people ask me, ""Why can\'t you do such a simple task?"" — this is scary for me, because Se is outside my comfort zone.\n\nBy the way, all successful people exhibit self-control, meaning they’re able to use their 3rd and 4th functions along with their 1st and 2nd. That means that they focus their energy on their Saviors while covering their weaknesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Consume First (Oe+Di)**\n\nThis means that this personality perceives a lot of information (Oe). Who for? For themselves (Di). They’re someone who wakes up in the morning and reaches for their phone to check out what’s going on, and checks, checks, checks. Or if they read a book, or study a particular subject, they won’t stop researching until they know everything about it.\n\n**Blast First (Oi+De)**\n\nThis personality reads 3 pages from a new book and instantly says, “OMG! This is the best thing ever. Everybody should know about this!” It’s teaching, directing, giving their opinion, appearing an “expert”, learning as they go, processing the same info over and over. It’s someone who wants to see results. When do they want to see them? NOW!\n\n**Sleep First (Oi+Di)**\n\n“I know, that even if I have the worst Se around me —if the world goes crazy, if everything is bad — I can create my own nice, safe and orderly world in my head. Somehow what is inside us is able to affect the world around us. I don’t understand how it works, but it does work. And if it’s not the case yet, but I can picture it happening, then I can make it become a reality. Why do we continually try to create an ideal situation using the same old tools and following the same old methods? Why not try to picture your ideal situation, and then figure out how to create it in our real world?”\n\n**Play First (Oe+De)**\n\nThis is a very energetic person, very enthusiastic, like “Go! Go! Go!”. Someone who brings up 7 topics in like 2 minutes. The other person is like a cat that you’re trying to catch in a bag, because you need to keep to your topic in order to get something out of this conversation. But by continually changing the subject, the Player is constantly trying to jump out. This personality spends a lot of energy and effort.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPD:\n\nEnergy dom = Sleep + Play in the top 3 Animals\n\nInfo dom = Consume + Blast in the top 3 Animals\n\n(Source https://youtu.be/CXs3ZTgewZw )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh sure, I know you’re unique and you can accomplish anything! But you will do it in your own particular way, so first you need to find out what your strengths are. Honestly, you can’t type yourself, because you can’t observe yourself.

We know we can count on our Saviors, because we know how well we can use them. We also know we will be successful because leaning on them doesn’t exhaust us. It’s even fun sometimes to show off our dominant function. Why can’t other people do that too?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demons (3rd and 4th functions)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we talk about something that requires our Tertiary and/or Inferior function, we’re talking about SERIOUS topics. (*We don’t ban anyone for addressing serious issues here, but if you’re in your Demons, at least try not to sound crabby or condescending*). This is hard, we know that, and we recognize that we are bad at that, because it takes real effort to confront our Demons. When we see that other people are good at our Demons, we feel insecure. For example, my Inferior function is Se. I don&amp;#39;t like it, but I see that other people use it well. They’re good at Se, and I know that I’m bad at that. Other people ask me, &amp;quot;Why can&amp;#39;t you do such a simple task?&amp;quot; — this is scary for me, because Se is outside my comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, all successful people exhibit self-control, meaning they’re able to use their 3rd and 4th functions along with their 1st and 2nd. That means that they focus their energy on their Saviors while covering their weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consume First (Oe+Di)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This means that this personality perceives a lot of information (Oe). Who for? For themselves (Di). They’re someone who wakes up in the morning and reaches for their phone to check out what’s going on, and checks, checks, checks. Or if they read a book, or study a particular subject, they won’t stop researching until they know everything about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blast First (Oi+De)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This personality reads 3 pages from a new book and instantly says, “OMG! This is the best thing ever. Everybody should know about this!” It’s teaching, directing, giving their opinion, appearing an “expert”, learning as they go, processing the same info over and over. It’s someone who wants to see results. When do they want to see them? NOW!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep First (Oi+Di)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I know, that even if I have the worst Se around me —if the world goes crazy, if everything is bad — I can create my own nice, safe and orderly world in my head. Somehow what is inside us is able to affect the world around us. I don’t understand how it works, but it does work. And if it’s not the case yet, but I can picture it happening, then I can make it become a reality. Why do we continually try to create an ideal situation using the same old tools and following the same old methods? Why not try to picture your ideal situation, and then figure out how to create it in our real world?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play First (Oe+De)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a very energetic person, very enthusiastic, like “Go! Go! Go!”. Someone who brings up 7 topics in like 2 minutes. The other person is like a cat that you’re trying to catch in a bag, because you need to keep to your topic in order to get something out of this conversation. But by continually changing the subject, the Player is constantly trying to jump out. This personality spends a lot of energy and effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;UPD:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Energy dom = Sleep + Play in the top 3 Animals&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Info dom = Consume + Blast in the top 3 Animals&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Source &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/CXs3ZTgewZw""&gt;https://youtu.be/CXs3ZTgewZw&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh sure, I know you’re unique and you can accomplish anything!

,ESTJ,"Hey

I took the official mbti test and tested as an ESTJ. Didnt think I would have gotten ESTJ. I thought ESTP or maybe ENTJ. 
Anyways after reading about the cognitive functions and more in depth descriptions of ESTJ's it sounds a lot like me. However some things I noticed were absent in the descriptions.

I am a huge nerd for the fantasy, sci fi and horror genre(movies,books,tv,games). I play dnd and love video games.

I'm a metal and punk fan. Didnt know of any xstj musicians. Can't find any online.

I'm rebellious not for the sake of it although when I was younger I was. I have no problem standing up for myself or others. 

OTHER RANDOM INFO


I point out discrepancies when i see them or if something doesnt make sense. I'm told I can be pretty black and white even though I consider myself open minded.

My humor is whatever What We Do in the Shadows and Mystery Science Theatre 3000 is.

I like reviews(it doesn't deter me if the review is bad as I can make my own judgement) but there's a youtuber called beyondthetrailer I like the way the reviews are laid out by category. I lay out things very similarly.

My wife(intp) I'm more logic/reason minded. I do like science though. It's what helped me come out of religion.

I'm an athiest and I'm very liberal in a family of born again Christians and conservatives. I left home at 17 to not have to be around it. I came out of religion around 13 and it was hell until I left. Religion just doesn't compute with my brain.

I quote movies or TV shows throughout the day

I have a morning routine that I hate being interrupted. If it is I go right back to it asap

Politics interest me and I enjoy debating

I hate being micro managed

Work first play later. I will get all the non fun stuff out of the way asap to be able to relax.

Short tempered, always have been

Facts are important to me

Do jigsaw puzzles frequently and read

I dont sugar coat anything

Dependable and loyal

,ESTJ,"28yo woman here. So I am in a predicament for the past few years and I have been thinking a lot about it. Currently I plan to save more money for many reasons for the next year or two so I still have time to make up my mind.

On to the issue. I have two bachelor degrees in my country in the social work field. I mostly enjoy the administration work I do and help people get justice that way rather than face to face contact. I am rather asocial in a way. And I don't know how to make up my mind between these two goals:

A) Stay in my country and pursue my career goal of working in higher education such as a university or college as a social worker. This feels like a safer and more comfortable option for me. More secure.

B) Move to the country of my dreams but most likely having to give up my social work career and work in a totally unrelated field. As a social worker speaking the native language is often a standard requirement and the country I would want to go to is Finland so yeah. I personally wouldn't mind that much doing another type of job. I like my career but by no means have any huge goals here that I really want to achieve.

In option A I would also buy property here which was my plan. But option B was/is my dream for the past decade, so I would also better keep saving my money and not buy property here.

,ESTJ,"I am an ESTJ and a sitcom lover. I watched Friends and New Girl before and I knew Schmidt and Monica are ESTJs. Today I was watching a New Girl episode and I realized that they have lots of things in common like cleaning, cooking and basically being the 'mom' of the group. But I also noticed that they both used to be fat from childhood to college (?). And it is shown that being fat is the reason for some of their typical ESTJ behavior (like control issues).
